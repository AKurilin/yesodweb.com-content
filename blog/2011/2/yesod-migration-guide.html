<p>Well, Yesod 0.7 is almost ready for release. Thanks to everyone for some great ideas: I consider the &quot;Please Break Yesod&quot; campaign to be a huge success. There have been a huge number of API tweaks, feature enhancements, and all around goodness.</p>
<p>I have just converted the <a href="http://www.haskellers.com">Haskellers</a> codebase to Yesod 0.7, and have taken detailed notes on changes you'll need to make. The process is not that bad really: it took about half an hour for me to convert the code <strong>and</strong> write up the docs.</p>
<p>So that we can get inline commenting, I've put the guide up as <a href="http://docs.yesodweb.com/book/migrate6to7/">a chapter of the Yesod book</a>. I'm planning on making the actual release Saturday night Israel time, assuming I don't get any major bug reports before then.</p>
<p>I will hold off on the list of new features for the release announcement. However, I <em>have</em> just released some new packages: Hamlet 0.7, Persistent 0.4 and wai-handler-devel 0.2. Some quick comments:</p>
<ul><li><p>Hamlet 0.7 involves a lot of new syntax changes. I appreciate the community's feedback on this: I think we've created a much better product. Check out <a href="http://docs.yesodweb.com/blog/hamlet6to7/">my previous blog post</a> for migration information, and the <a href="http://wiki.yesodweb.com/Hamlet%200.7%20changes">Wiki page</a> for some of the surrounding discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>Persistent saw no real changes. The main reason for the new major version number is the migration to the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-peel">monad-peel package</a>. By the way, that package is a work of art, I strongly recommend people start looking into it as a replacement for MonadCatchIO-*. Anders has done an amazing job.</p></li>
<li><p>wai-handler-devel has a much more elegant underlying approach (which if I had time I would blog about). It's actually getting close to a proper plugin system, which is something I'm interested for my upcoming LambdaEngine project. &lt;/tease&gt;</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-site-design">New site design</h2>
<p>I've also finally revamped the Yesod site to use the new Haskell color theme that's been going around. I personally like the change, but wouldn't mind any critiques. We also have a new Yesod logo. If it looks a little funny to you, flip it upside down, it should look more familiar that way.</p>
<h2 id="yackage">Yackage</h2>
<p>For those of you who can't wait, or who want to help me out with some testing, you can get the most current version of the packages from <a href="http://yackage.yesodweb.com/">Yackage</a>. If you find any bugs, please let me know!</p>
