<h1>The Resource monad transformer</h1>
  <p class="hascomments">The Resource transformer (<code>ResourceT</code>) plays a vital role in proper resource
   management in the conduit project. It is included within the <code>conduit</code> package
   itself. We&#39;ll explaining <code>ResourceT</code> as its own entity. While some of the design
   decisions clearly are biased towards conduits, <code>ResourceT</code> should remain a usable
   tool in its own right.</p>
 <section class="subtopic" id="file1675-conceptId"><h1>Goals</h1>
  <p class="hascomments">What&#39;s wrong with the following code?</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;"><span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: blue;">System.IO</span>

<span style="color: blue;font-weight: bold;">main</span> = <span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">do</span>
    output &lt;- openFile <span style="color: green;">&quot;output.txt&quot;</span> <span style="color: blue;">WriteMode</span>
    input  &lt;- openFile <span style="color: green;">&quot;input.txt&quot;</span>  <span style="color: blue;">ReadMode</span>
    hGetContents input &gt;&gt;= hPutStr output
    hClose input
    hClose output
</pre></pre>
  <p class="hascomments">If the file <code class="filepath">input.txt</code> does not exist, then an exception will be thrown
   when trying to open it. As a result, <code>hClose output</code> will never be called, and
   we&#39;ll have leaked a scarce resource (a file descriptor). In our tiny program, this isn&#39;t a big
   deal, but clearly we can&#39;t afford such waste in a long running, highly active server process.</p>
  <p class="hascomments">Fortunately, solving the problem is easy:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;"><span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: blue;">System.IO</span>

<span style="color: blue;font-weight: bold;">main</span> =
    withFile <span style="color: green;">&quot;output.txt&quot;</span> <span style="color: blue;">WriteMode</span> $ \output -&gt;
    withFile <span style="color: green;">&quot;input.txt&quot;</span> <span style="color: blue;">ReadMode</span> $ \input -&gt;
    hGetContents input &gt;&gt;= hPutStr output
</pre></pre>
  <p class="hascomments"><code>withFile</code> makes sure that the <code>Handle</code> is always closed, even in
   the presence of exceptions. It also handles asynchronous exceptions. Overall, it&#39;s a great
   approach to use... when you can use it. While often <code>withFile</code> is easy to use,
   sometimes it can require restructuring our programs. And this restructuring can range from mildly
   tedious to wildly inefficient.</p>
  <p class="hascomments">Let&#39;s take enumerators for example. If you look in the documentation, there is an
    <code>enumFile</code> function (for reading contents from a file), but no
    <code>iterFile</code> (for writing contents to a file). That&#39;s because the flow of control
   in an iteratee doesn&#39;t allow proper allocation of the Handle. Instead, in order to write to a
   file, you need to allocate the Handle before entering the Iteratee, e.g.:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;"><span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: blue;">System.IO</span>
<span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: blue;">Data.Enumerator</span>
<span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: blue;">Data.Enumerator.Binary</span>

<span style="color: blue;font-weight: bold;">main</span> =
    withFile <span style="color: green;">&quot;output.txt&quot;</span> <span style="color: blue;">WriteMode</span> $ \output -&gt;
    run_ $ enumFile <span style="color: green;">&quot;input.txt&quot;</span> $$ iterHandle output
</pre></pre>
  <p class="hascomments">This code works fine, but imagine that, instead of simply piping data directly to the file,
   there was a huge amount of computation that occurred before we need to use the output handle. We
   will have allocated a file descriptor long before we needed it, and thereby locked up a scarce
   resource in our application. Besides this, there are times when we <i>can&#39;t</i> allocate the file
   before hand, such as when we won&#39;t know which file to open until we&#39;ve read from the input
   file.</p>
  <p class="hascomments">One of the stated goals of conduits is to solve this problem, and it does so via
    <code>ResourceT</code>. As a result, the above program can be written in conduit as:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;"><span style="color: gray;">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}</span>
<span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: blue;">Data.Conduit</span>
<span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: blue;">Data.Conduit.Binary</span>

<span style="color: blue;font-weight: bold;">main</span> = runResourceT $ sourceFile <span style="color: green;">&quot;input.txt&quot;</span> $$ sinkFile <span style="color: green;">&quot;output.txt&quot;</span>
</pre></pre>
 </section><section class="subtopic" id="file1676-conceptId"><h1>How it Works</h1>
  <p class="hascomments">There are essentially three base functions on <code>ResourceT</code>, and then a bunch of
   conveniences thrown on top. The first function is:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;"><span style="color: blue;font-weight: bold;">register</span> :: <span style="color: blue;">IO</span> () -&gt; <span style="color: blue;">ResourceT</span> <span style="color: blue;">IO</span> <span style="color: blue;">ReleaseKey</span>
</pre></pre>
  <aside class="note">This function, and the others below, are actually more polymorphic than implied here,
   allowing other monads besides <code>IO</code>. In fact, almost any transformer on top of
    <code>IO</code>, as well as any <code>ST</code> stacks, work. We&#39;ll cover the details of
   that later.</aside>
  <p class="hascomments">This function registers a piece of code that it asserts <b>must</b> be run. It gives back a
    <code>ReleaseKey</code>, which is used by the next function:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;"><span style="color: blue;font-weight: bold;">release</span> :: <span style="color: blue;">ReleaseKey</span> -&gt; <span style="color: blue;">ResourceT</span> <span style="color: blue;">IO</span> ()
</pre></pre>
  <p class="hascomments">Calling <code>release</code> on a <code>ReleaseKey</code> immediately performs the
   action you previously registered. You may call <code>release</code> on the same
    <code>ReleaseKey</code> as many times as you like; the first time it is called, it
    <dfn>unregisters</dfn> the action. This means you can safely register an action like a memory
   free, and have no concerns that it will be called twice.</p>
  <p class="hascomments">Eventually, we&#39;ll want to exit our special <code>ResourceT</code>. To do so, we use:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;"><span style="color: blue;font-weight: bold;">runResourceT</span> :: <span style="color: blue;">ResourceT</span> <span style="color: blue;">IO</span> a -&gt; <span style="color: blue;">IO</span> a
</pre></pre>
  <p class="hascomments">This seemingly innocuous function is where all the magic happens. It runs through all of the
   registered cleanup actions and performs them. It is fully exception safe, meaning the cleanups
   will be performed in the presence of both synchronous and asynchronous exceptions. And as
   mentioned before, calling <code>release</code> will unregister an action, so there is no
   concern of double-freeing.</p>
  <p class="hascomments">Finally, as a convenience, we provide one more function for the common case of allocating a
   resource and registering a release action:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;"><span style="color: blue;font-weight: bold;">with</span> :: <span style="color: blue;">IO</span> a <span style="color: gray;">-- ^ allocate</span>
     -&gt; (a -&gt; <span style="color: blue;">IO</span> ()) <span style="color: gray;">-- ^ free resource</span>
     -&gt; <span style="color: blue;">ResourceT</span> <span style="color: blue;">IO</span> (<span style="color: blue;">ReleaseKey</span>, a)
</pre></pre>
  <p class="hascomments">So, to rework our first buggy example to use <code>ResourceT</code>, we would write:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;"><span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: blue;">System.IO</span>
<span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: blue;">Control.Monad.Trans.Resource</span>
<span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: blue;">Control.Monad.Trans.Class</span> (lift)

<span style="color: blue;font-weight: bold;">main</span> = runResourceT $ <span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">do</span>
    (releaseO, output) &lt;- with (openFile <span style="color: green;">&quot;output.txt&quot;</span> <span style="color: blue;">WriteMode</span>) hClose
    (releaseI, input)  &lt;- with (openFile <span style="color: green;">&quot;input.txt&quot;</span>  <span style="color: blue;">ReadMode</span>)  hClose
    lift $ hGetContents input &gt;&gt;= hPutStr output
    release releaseI
    release releaseO
</pre></pre>
  <p class="hascomments">Now there is no concern of any exceptions preventing the releasing of resources. We could skip
   the <code>release</code> calls if we want to, and in an example this small, it would not make
   any difference. But for larger applications, where we want processing to continue, this ensures
   that the <code>Handle</code>s are freed as early as possible, keeping our scarce resource
   usage to a minimum.</p>
 </section><section class="subtopic" id="file1677-conceptId"><h1>Some Type Magic</h1>
  <p class="hascomments">As alluded to, there&#39;s a bit more to <code>ResourceT</code> than simply running in
    <code>IO</code>. Let&#39;s cover some of the things we need from this underlying
    <code>Monad</code>.</p>
  <ul id="file1677-conceptId-ul_obv_tyw_re"><li>Mutable references to keep track of the registered release actions. You might think we could
    just use a <code>StateT</code> transformer, but then our state wouldn&#39;t survive
    exceptions.</li>
   <li>We only want to register actions in the <dfn>base monad</dfn>. For example, if we have a
     <code>ResourceT (WriterT [Int] IO)</code> stack, we only want to register
     <code>IO</code> actions. This makes it easy to lift our stacks around (i.e., add an extra
    transformer to the middle of an existing stack), and avoids confusing issues about the threading
    of other monadic side-effects.</li>
   <li>Some way to guarantee an action is performed, even in the presence of exceptions. This boils
    down to needing a <code>bracket</code>-like function.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="hascomments">For the first point, we define a new typeclass to represent monads that have mutable
   references:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;"><span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">class</span> <span style="color: blue;">Monad</span> m =&gt; <span style="color: blue;">HasRef</span> m <span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">where</span>
    <span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: blue;">Ref</span> m :: * -&gt; *
    newRef&#39; :: a -&gt; m (<span style="color: blue;">Ref</span> m a)
    readRef&#39; :: <span style="color: blue;">Ref</span> m a -&gt; m a
    writeRef&#39; :: <span style="color: blue;">Ref</span> m a -&gt; a -&gt; m ()
    modifyRef&#39; :: <span style="color: blue;">Ref</span> m a -&gt; (a -&gt; (a, b)) -&gt; m b
    mask :: ((forall a. m a -&gt; m a) -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b
    mask_ :: m a -&gt; m a
    try :: m a -&gt; m (<span style="color: blue;">Either</span> <span style="color: blue;">SomeException</span> a)
</pre></pre>
  <p class="hascomments">We have an associated type to signify what the reference type should be. (For fans of fundeps,
   you&#39;ll see in the next section that this <i>has</i> to be an associated type.) Then we provide a
   number of basic reference operations. Finally, there are some functions to help with exceptions,
   which are needed to safely implement the functions described in the last section. The instance
   for <code>IO</code> is very straight-forward:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;"><span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">instance</span> <span style="color: blue;">HasRef</span> <span style="color: blue;">IO</span> <span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">where</span>
    <span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: blue;">Ref</span> <span style="color: blue;">IO</span> = <span style="color: blue;">I.IORef</span>
    newRef&#39; = <span style="color: blue;">I.</span>newIORef
    modifyRef&#39; = <span style="color: blue;">I.</span>atomicModifyIORef
    readRef&#39; = <span style="color: blue;">I.</span>readIORef
    writeRef&#39; = <span style="color: blue;">I.</span>writeIORef
    mask = <span style="color: blue;">E.</span>mask
    mask_ = <span style="color: blue;">E.</span>mask_
    try = <span style="color: blue;">E.</span>try
</pre></pre>
  <p class="hascomments">However, we have a problem when it comes to implementing the <code>ST</code> instance:
   there is no way to deal with exceptions in the <code>ST</code> monad. As a result,
    <code>mask</code>, <code>mask_</code> and <code>try</code> are given default
   implementations that do no exception checking. This gives rise to the first word of warning:
    <b>operations in the ST monad are not exception safe</b>. You should not be allocating scarce
   resources in ST when using <code>ResourceT</code>. You might be wondering why bother with
    <code>ResourceT</code> at all then for <code>ST</code>. The answer is that there is a
   lot you can do with conduits without allocating scarce resources, and <code>ST</code> is a
   great way to do this in a pure way. But more on this later.</p>
  <p class="hascomments">Now onto point 2: we need some way to deal with this base monad concept. Again, we use an
   associated type (again explained in the next section). Our solution looks something like:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;"><span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">class</span> (<span style="color: blue;">HasRef</span> (<span style="color: blue;">Base</span> m), <span style="color: blue;">Monad</span> m) =&gt; <span style="color: blue;">Resource</span> m <span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">where</span>
    <span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: blue;">Base</span> m :: * -&gt; *

    resourceLiftBase :: <span style="color: blue;">Base</span> m a -&gt; m a
</pre></pre>
  <p class="hascomments">But we forgot about point 3: some <code>bracket</code>-like function. So we need one more
   method in this typeclass:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;">resourceBracket_ :: <span style="color: blue;">Base</span> m a -&gt; <span style="color: blue;">Base</span> m b -&gt; m c -&gt; m c
</pre></pre>
  <p class="hascomments">The reason the first two arguments to <code>resourceBracket_</code> (allocation and
   cleanup) live in <code>Base m</code> instead of <code>m</code> is that, in
    <code>ResourceT</code>, all allocation and cleanup lives in the base monad.</p>
  <p class="hascomments">So on top of our <code>HasRef</code> instance for <code>IO</code>, we now need a
    <code>Resource</code> instance as well. This is similarly straight-forward:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;"><span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">instance</span> <span style="color: blue;">Resource</span> <span style="color: blue;">IO</span> <span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">where</span>
    <span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: blue;">Base</span> <span style="color: blue;">IO</span> = <span style="color: blue;">IO</span>
    resourceLiftBase = id
    resourceBracket_ = <span style="color: blue;">E.</span>bracket_
</pre></pre>
  <p class="hascomments">We have similar <code>ST</code> instances, with <code>resourceBracket_</code> having no
   exception safety. The final step is dealing with monad transformers. We don&#39;t need to provide a
    <code>HasRef</code> instance, but we do need a <code>Resource</code> instance. The
   tricky part is providing a valid implementation of <code>resourceBracket_</code>. For this,
   we use some functions from <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-control">monad-control</a>:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;"><span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">instance</span> (<span style="color: blue;">MonadTransControl</span> t, <span style="color: blue;">Resource</span> m, <span style="color: blue;">Monad</span> (t m))
        =&gt; <span style="color: blue;">Resource</span> (t m) <span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">where</span>
    <span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: blue;">Base</span> (t m) = <span style="color: blue;">Base</span> m

    resourceLiftBase = lift . resourceLiftBase
    resourceBracket_ a b c =
        control&#39; $ \run -&gt; resourceBracket_ a b (run c)
      <span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">where</span>
        control&#39; f = liftWith f &gt;&gt;= restoreT . return
</pre></pre>
  <p class="hascomments">For any transformer, its base is the base of its inner monad. Similarly, we lift to the base by
   lifting to the inner monad and then lifting to the base from there. The tricky part is the
   implemetnation of <code>resourceBracket_</code>. I will not go into a detailed explanation,
   as I would simply make a fool of myself.</p>
 </section><section class="subtopic" id="file1678-conceptId"><h1>Definition of ResourceT</h1>
  <p class="hascomments">We now have enough information to understand the definition of <code>ResourceT</code>:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><pre style="padding: 0;margin: 0;"><span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">newtype</span> <span style="color: blue;">ReleaseKey</span> = <span style="color: blue;">ReleaseKey</span> <span style="color: blue;">Int</span>

<span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: blue;">RefCount</span> = <span style="color: blue;">Int</span>
<span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: blue;">NextKey</span> = <span style="color: blue;">Int</span>

<span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">data</span> <span style="color: blue;">ReleaseMap</span> base =
    <span style="color: blue;">ReleaseMap</span> !<span style="color: blue;">NextKey</span> !<span style="color: blue;">RefCount</span> !(<span style="color: blue;">IntMap</span> (base ()))

<span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">newtype</span> <span style="color: blue;">ResourceT</span> m a =
    <span style="color: blue;">ResourceT</span> (<span style="color: blue;">Ref</span> (<span style="color: blue;">Base</span> m) (<span style="color: blue;">ReleaseMap</span> (<span style="color: blue;">Base</span> m)) -&gt; m a)
</pre></pre>
  <p class="hascomments">We see that <code>ReleaseKey</code> is simply an <code>Int</code>. If you skip a few
   lines down, this will make sense, since we&#39;re using an <code>IntMap</code> to keep track of
   the registered actions. We also define two type synonyms: <code>RefCount</code> and
    <code>NextKey</code>. <code>NextKey</code> keeps track of the most recently assigned
   value for a key, and is incremented each time <code>register</code> is called. We&#39;ll touch on
    <code>RefCount</code> later.</p>
  <p class="hascomments">The <code>ReleaseMap</code> is three pieces of information: the next key and the reference
   count, and then the map of all registered actions. Notice that <code>ReleaseMap</code> takes
   a type parameter <code>base</code>, which states which monad release actions must live
   in.</p>
  <p class="hascomments">Finally, a <code>ResourceT</code> is essentially a <code>ReaderT</code> that keeps a
   mutable reference to a <code>ReleaseMap</code>. The reference type is determined by the base
   of the monad in question, as is the cleanup monad. This is why we need to use associated
   types.</p>
  <p class="hascomments">The majority of the rest of the code in the <code>Control.Monad.Trans.Resource</code>
   module is just providing instances for the <code>ResourceT</code> type.</p>
 </section><section class="subtopic" id="file1679-conceptId"><h1>Other Typeclasses</h1>
  <p class="hascomments">There are three other typeclasses provided by the module:</p>
  <dl><dt>ResourceUnsafeIO</dt>
    <dd>Any monad which can lift <code>IO</code> actions into it, but that this may be
     considered unsafe. The prime candidate here is <code>ST</code>. Care should be taken to
     only lift actions which do not acquire scarce resources and which don&#39;t &quot;fire the missiles.&quot; In
     other words, all the normal warnings of <code>unsafeIOToST</code> apply.</dd>
   
   
    <dt>ResourceThrow</dt>
    <dd>For actions that can throw exceptions. This automatically applies to all
     <code>IO</code>-based monads. For <code>ST</code>-based monads, you can use the
     supplied <code>ExceptionT</code> transformer to provide exception-throwing capabilities.
     Some functions in conduit, for example, will require this (e.g., text decoding).</dd>
   
   
    <dt>ResourceIO</dt>
    <dd>A convenience class tying together a bunch of other classes, included the two mentioned
     above. This is purely for convenience; you could achieve the same effect without this type
     class, you&#39;d just have to do a lot more typing.</dd>
   
  </dl>
 </section><section class="subtopic" id="file1680-conceptId"><h1>Forking</h1>
  <p class="hascomments">It would seem that forking a thread would be inherently unsafe with <code>ResourceT</code>,
   since the parent thread may call <code>runResourceT</code> while the child thread is still
   accessing some of the allocated resources. This is indeed true, <i>if</i> you use the normal
    <code>forkIO</code> function.</p>
  <aside class="note">You can&#39;t actually use the standard <code>forkIO</code>, since it only operates in the
    <code>IO</code> monad, but you could use the <code>fork</code> function from
    <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lifted-base">lifted-base</a>. In fact, due to this issue, the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/regions">regions</a>
   package does not provide a <code>MonadBaseControl</code> instance for its transformer (which
   is very similar to <code>ResourceT</code>). However, our goal in <code>ResourceT</code>
   is not to make it impossible for programmers to mess up, only to make it easier to do the right
   thing. Therefore, we still provide the instance, even though it could be abused.</aside>
  <p class="hascomments">In order to solve this, <code>ResourceT</code> includes reference counting. When you fork a
   new thread via <code>resourceForkIO</code>, the <code>RefCount</code> value of the
    <code>ReleaseMap</code> is incremented. Every time <code>runResourceT</code> is called,
   the value is decremented. Only when the value hits 0 are all the release actions called.</p>
 </section><section class="subtopic" id="file1681-conceptId"><h1>Convenience Exports</h1>
  <p class="hascomments">In addition to what&#39;s been listed so far, there are a few extra functions exported (mostly) for
   convenience.</p>
  <ul id="file1681-conceptId-ul_hsd_yex_re"><li><code>newRef</code>, <code>writeRef</code>, and <code>readRef</code> wrap up the
     <code>HasRef</code> versions of the functions and allow them to run in any

    but working around some of the nastiness with types you would otherwise run into. In general:
    you&#39;ll want to use <code>withIO</code> when writing <code>IO</code> code.</li>
   <li><code>transResourceT</code> let&#39;s you modify which monad your ResourceT is running in,
