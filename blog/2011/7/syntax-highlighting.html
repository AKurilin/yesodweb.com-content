<p>For everyone who's been asking for it, I've just adding syntax highlighting and line numbering to most of the Haskell code snippets. I'm using John McFarlane's very nice <a href="https://github.com/jgm/illuminate">illuminate</a> package for this. If you notice any problems, please let me know.</p>
