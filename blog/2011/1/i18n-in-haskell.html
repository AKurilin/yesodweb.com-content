<p>I got a feature request from Антон Чешков to allow the messages in the yesod-auth package to be user-customizable. Adding such a feature is fairly simple: I added a whole bunch of methods to the YesodAuth typeclass, one for each method. While that works, I'm not happy with the result. Besides being an ugly solution, there is a much more fundamental problem: <em>it only support one language</em>.</p>
<p>Yesod does in theory have i18n support. There is a function for getting a list of languages that the user accepts, and support for using cookies to override the Accept-Language field. This is all well and good, but it's like saying a car supports flying, all you need is a catapult. (Sorry, I couldn't resist a car analogy.)</p>
<p>In theory, I think multi-lingual support needs to be added at the <em>template</em> level, in Yesod's case, Hamlet. However, we first need to figure out the right approach to I18N for Haskell in general. Consider what I'm about to present a straw man: I want to hear why this is such a bad idea.</p>
<p>Let's start by making a bold assertion: gettext is a huge, ugly hack. Sure, it works fine for static strings like &quot;Hello World&quot;. Of course, there's no compile-time checks to make sure you didn't accidently use &quot;Hello world&quot; (lower-case w) or &quot;Hello World!&quot;. But that's not even the big hack: imagine I want to output something as simple a &quot;&lt;count&gt; &lt;object&gt;(s)&quot;. gettext has trouble with this because:</p>
<ul><li>We need to be able to pluralize things.</li>
<li>Believe it or not, not every language puts their numbers before their objects. (In Hebrew, for instance, you can say the equivalent of &quot;house one&quot; or &quot;two houses&quot;.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure others with more gettext experience than I can explain both how to work around these issues, and how there are even <em>worse</em> hacks involved. Frankly, that's not our issue here. Let's see how we can leverage the strengths of Haskell for this. I present my strawman (explanation below):</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/778712.js?file=i18n.hs"></script>

<p>I start off with the MaybeRead typeclass. It's not really i18n specific, it's just used for parsing the language datatype from strings. The meat of this sample is lines 8-12. We define an I18N typeclass with two associated datatypes: a datatype to represent languages, and an output datatype for displaying the messages.</p>
<p>So why bother with the language datatype? After all, there <em>are</em> international language codes that we could rely on. The reason is twofold: we can parse our language code <em>once</em> into a Haskell datatype, helping performance, and more importantly, we can pattern match and the compiler will tell us if we missed a translation. I think the message datatype is more obvious: some people will want String, some Text, and some Html.</p>
<p>i18n tries to translate your datatype into a message. It returns its value in a Maybe to let you know that there is no translation for the specified language available. There is also i18nDefault, which gives the default translation for a value.</p>
<p>Since we can limit the range of languages using the Language associated type, why not just have i18n return the value outside of Maybe and skip the i18nDefault? A few reasons:</p>
<ul><li><p>It's likely that people will want to use more generic Language datatypes, which would include languages that their application does not support.</p></li>
<li><p>In the context of web applications, you don't just get a requested language, you get a prioritized list of languages. This allows you to try out different languages until you get a match.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The two example helper functions, i18nLang and i18nLangs, demonstrate two standard use cases for this class: translated to a specific language, and translated to one of many languages. The rest of the gist is a simple example of translated messages for a number guessing game.</p>
<p>Oh, and since the code to generate the messages is actual Haskell, you can due any kinds of manipulations you want. You are <em>not</em> constrained to the order in which the arguments are provided, you can use any logic you want to make plural words, you can even do complex date formatting or &quot;fuzzy times&quot; if you want.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's almost 1 in the morning here, so perhaps this won't be too coherent, but I hope we can come up with a good general solution for i18n in Haskell. Let me know what you think!</p>
