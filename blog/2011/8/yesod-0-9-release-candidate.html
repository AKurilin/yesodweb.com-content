<h1>What&#39;s new?</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file784-whats-new-x1">You can get a taste for the new stuff in the 0.9.0 release from the <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/page/changelog">ChangeLog
    page</a>. In general, this is a very stable, well-tested release. The beta is being actively
   used in a number of production sites, including this one, with no reported ill effects. The Yesod
   team feels very strongly that this is an upgrade worth making as soon as possible.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file784-whats-new-x3">The purpose of the release candidate is to try to get any last-minute input on bugs or bad
   decisions before they are set in stone with the official release. I highly encourage everyone
   using Yesod to install the release candidate and test it out on a few of your sites.</p>
 <h1>Get set up for Yackage</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file785-get-set-up-for-yackage-x1">The 0.9 release candidate is available on the <a href="http://yackage.yesodweb.com/">Yesod Yackage server</a>. Note that the version numbers are
   the same as will be released with the final release. That means that, if you install the RC, it&#39;s
   highly recommended to wipe your .ghc folder after the official release comes out.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file785-get-set-up-for-yackage-x3">In order to install the release candidate, follow these steps:</p>
  <ol id="file785-get-set-up-for-yackage-ol_hkl_fwc_kd"><li id="file785-get-set-up-for-yackage-x4">Add the following line to your <code class="filepath" id="file785-get-set-up-for-yackage-x5">~/.cabal/config</code>
    file:<pre class="codeblock" id="file785-get-set-up-for-yackage-x6">remote-repo: yesod-yackage:http://yackage.yesodweb.com</pre></li>
   <li id="file785-get-set-up-for-yackage-x7">Run <code id="file785-get-set-up-for-yackage-x8">cabal update</code></li>

 <h1>Migration guide: Yesod 0.8 to 0.9</h1>  <p class="hascomments" id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x1">As has become a bit of a custom, we&#39;re going to go through the necessary changes to the
   Haskellers codebase to get it to work with the new release. Fortunately, there are many less
   steps in this release. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/snoyberg/haskellers/commit/1ba421449c29d8d2b653055b746ee1afe98430e9">entire commit on Github</a>. To give you an idea of time
   investment, it took me about two hours to migrate Haskellers, write this guide, and apply a few
   minor tweaks to the framework in the process.</p>
  <ol id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-ol_sap_jic_kd"><li id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x3">Fix up your cabal file. For the most part, just change yesod to version 0.9 and watch the
    fallout. Pay particular attention to the version bounds on related packages like hamlet and
    persistent. Also:<ul id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-ul_bqz_mic_kd"><li id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x4">hamlet has been split out into multiple packages. You&#39;ll likely get build errors telling
      you to add shakespeare-css and shakespeare-js</li>
     <li id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x5">Due to issues with the newest aeson and Template Haskell, we had to create a fork. The API
      is identical, the only difference is in how doubles are rendered. Just updated any references
      to aeson to be aeson-native.</li>
    </ul></li>
   <li id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x6">Goodbye &quot;Helpers&quot; module namespace. This affects Yesod.Helpers.Static, Yesod.Helpers.Auth.*,
    Yesod.Helpers.Feed.* and others. All you need to do is remove the word Helpers.</li>
   <li id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x7">The datatypes from hamlet have been renamed. This likely doesn&#39;t affect much code, but just
    be aware of it.<table id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-simpletable_aiq_yic_kd"><thead id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x8"><td id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x9">Old name</td>

   <li id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x23">Forms have had a significant overhaul. This will be the most labor-intensive part of the
    migration. I&#39;ll address this later.</li>
   <li id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x24">In your Model.hs file, mkPersist now takes an extra parameter to give it settings. For now
    use sqlSettings, we&#39;ll have some more options in the future.</li>
   <li id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x25">Model.hs needs the GADTs language extension enabled.</li>
   <li id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x26">In your application file (e.g., Haskellers.hs), remove the type synonyms for Handler and
    Widget. This is now provided by the TH code. Also, instead of Widget (), just say Widget.</li>
   <li id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x27">In the YesodPersist instance, change &quot;YesodDB&quot; to &quot;YesodPersistBackend&quot;.</li>
   <li id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x28">The other big change: the filter API for persistent became <b id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x29">much</b> simpler. Instead of
    using constructors like &quot;PersonNameEq&quot;, we now just use operators. (Thanks to Boris for the
     <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/groundhog">groundhog</a> inspiration here.)

    is well worth it.</li>
   <li id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x43">select syntax has changed. Instead of having those two hanging integers at the end, we have a
    list of options. An example should suffice:<dl id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x44"><dt id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x46">Old</dt>

   <li id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x59">And a great sigh of relief was heard: polymorphic hamlet is gone. For the most part, this

    messages are confusing; just email the list if you get stuff on somthing.</li>

   <li id="file786-migration-guide-yesod-08-to-09-x60">We added i18n support for form messages. You&#39;ll need to add this to your application file
