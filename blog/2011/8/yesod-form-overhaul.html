<h1>Motivation</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file847-motivation-x1">We&#39;re about ready for the Yesod 0.9 release candidate, and we&#39;re trying to polish all the rough
   edges. Greg and I have been trying to get feedback on what&#39;s still missing and what could be done
   better. Luite Stegeman did a good job <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/yesodweb/browse_thread/thread/47cd8e311e1e50e1">pointing out some shortcomings</a> in the yesod-form package.
   I&#39;ve made some major changes, some not directly related to his comments.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file847-motivation-x3">Let&#39;s start off by identifying the issues we needed to solve.</p>
  <ul id="file847-motivation-ul_lpu_nlo_ed"><li id="file847-motivation-x4">No direct way to do validations like &quot;a number between 1 and 10&quot;. It was possible, just not
    easy.</li>
   <li id="file847-motivation-x5">No way at all to perform monadic validations (is this username taken? is this date in the
    past?).</li>
   <li id="file847-motivation-x6">To support i18n, we have the concept of message types. However, it hasn&#39;t been possible to
    mix different types for the most part.</li>
   <li id="file847-motivation-x7">Type signatures very quickly become unwieldy.</li>
  </ul>
 <h1>SomeMessage</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file848-somemessage-x1">A quick review of i18n in Yesod: we have a typeclass called <code id="file848-somemessage-x2">RenderMessage</code>
   defined
   as<pre class="codeblock" id="file848-somemessage-x3">class RenderMessage master message where
    renderMessage :: master
                  -&gt; [Text] -- ^ languages
                  -&gt; message
                  -&gt; Text</pre>This
   lets each application (distinguished by the master datatype) have its own sets of translations.
   Within yesod-form, we would end up with a msg type variable in a few places, such as for error
   messages from a field parser. And yesod-form defines a datatype <code id="file848-somemessage-x4">FormMessage</code>
   which it uses for all its messages.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file848-somemessage-x5">But let&#39;s say we want to have an integer field for numbers between 1 and 10. There are two
   things that can go wrong:<ul id="file848-somemessage-ul_tji_wmo_ed"><li id="file848-somemessage-x6">the user could submit a non-integer. For this we want to use the built-in error message from
     yesod-form of type FormMessage</li>
    <li id="file848-somemessage-x7">the user could enter an integer outside the range. Here we would want to use the application
     specific message type.</li>
   </ul></p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file848-somemessage-x8">The question is how do we combine two different datatypes together. The answer:
   existentials.<pre class="codeblock" id="file848-somemessage-x9">data SomeMessage master = forall msg. RenderMessage master msg =&gt; SomeMessage msg</pre>We
   now have a datatype that represents any message that can be translated for our application. By
   using this datatype in place of a msg type variable, we get to both achieve our primary goal and
   make our type signatures a bit shorter.</p>
 <h1>Less General Types</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file849-less-general-types-x1">Once we are in the swing of cleaning up our type signatures, let&#39;s go for the gold. yesod-form
   was originally designed based on formlets, which uses very general type signatures. formlets
   doesn&#39;t specify how the html should be stored or in what monad the form should run. Instead,
   those are all given as type parameters. And up until now, yesod-form has done the same thing.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file849-less-general-types-x2">However, this doesn&#39;t really make much sense for Yesod, where we know the user will be
   representing their view as Widgets and running in the Handler monad. So instead of leaving these
   to type parameters, we&#39;ve now fixed them in the types themselves. Now the types in yesod-form
   match up much more closely with the rest of the Yesod framework, taking parameters for the
   subsite, master site, and the contained value.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file849-less-general-types-x3">Hopefully this will make the library easier to use and make compiler error messages
   clearer.</p>
 <h1>Monadic field parser</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file850-monadic-field-parser-x1">Now with that maintenance overhead out of the way, we can start to focus on Luite&#39;s issues
   directly. Let&#39;s start by looking at the definition of the fieldParse record in a Field from a few
   days ago:<pre class="codeblock" id="file850-monadic-field-parser-x2">[Text] -&gt; Either msg (Maybe a)</pre>Fairly simple: take a list of
   parameters (remember, multiple values can be submitted for each field, like with multi-select
   fields) and either return an error message, Nothing if the input is missing, or the parsed value
   on success. (Missing input may or may not be an error, depending on if the field is required or
   optional.)</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file850-monadic-field-parser-x3">Now what we want is an easy way to add extra restriction onto that &quot;a&quot;. Let&#39;s take our number
   example from before. An intField from yesod-form would have a fieldParse looking like
    <code id="file850-monadic-field-parser-x4">[Text] -&gt; Either FormMessage (Maybe Int)</code>. We now want to tack on some code that
   can logically be expressed
   as:<pre class="codeblock" id="file850-monadic-field-parser-x5">data MyAppMessage = BelowOne | AboveTen
withinRange :: Int -&gt; Either MyAppMessage Int
withRange i
    | i &lt; 1 = Left BelowOne
    | i &gt; 10 = Left AboveTen
    | otherwise = Right i</pre>All
   we need is a way to attach our withinRange to our fieldParse.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file850-monadic-field-parser-x6">The first thing to point out is that our SomeMessage trick from earlier is absolutely necessary
   at this point. Without it, we would be forced to either include every possible error message in
   FormMessage, or redefine our built-in fields to use our custom error message type. Instead, we
   can now wrap up the error messages in a SomeMessage constructor and easily compose these two
   functions.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file850-monadic-field-parser-x7">But let&#39;s take the slightly more complicated case: a non-pure validator. There is no provision
   in fieldParse for monadic side effects. The solution for this is actually very simple: wrap the
   return in a
   monad:<pre class="codeblock" id="file850-monadic-field-parser-x8">data Field sub master a = Field
    { fieldParse :: [Text] -&gt; GGHandler sub master IO (Either (SomeMessage master) (Maybe a))
    , fieldView :: ...
    }</pre></p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file850-monadic-field-parser-x9">For our built-in fields the only change necessary is an added return.</p>
 <h1>The check functions</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file851-the-check-functions-x1">Now that the structure has been corrected, furnishing is easy. At this point, I&#39;ll let the code
   speak for itself:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock" id="file851-the-check-functions-x2">check :: RenderMessage master msg
      =&gt; (a -&gt; Either msg a) -&gt; Field sub master a -&gt; Field sub master a
check f = checkM $ return . f

-- | Return the given error message if the predicate is false.
checkBool :: RenderMessage master msg
          =&gt; (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; msg -&gt; Field sub master a -&gt; Field sub master a
checkBool b s = check $ \x -&gt; if b x then Right x else Left s

checkM :: RenderMessage master msg
       =&gt; (a -&gt; GGHandler sub master IO (Either msg a))
       -&gt; Field sub master a
       -&gt; Field sub master a
checkM f field = field
    { fieldParse = \ts -&gt; do
        e1 &lt;- fieldParse field ts
        case e1 of
            Left msg -&gt; return $ Left msg
            Right Nothing -&gt; return $ Right Nothing
            Right (Just a) -&gt; fmap (either (Left . SomeMessage) (Right . Just)) $ f a
    }</pre>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file851-the-check-functions-x3">And just to motivate this a bit more, the use code from the <a href="https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/blob/master/yesod-form/hello-forms.hs">hello-forms.hs sample</a>. Note that this code simply uses Text values for
   its validation messages. If you&#39;re not concerned with i18n, this is always an option in your
   applications.</p>
  <pre class="codeblock" id="file851-the-check-functions-x5">myValidForm = runFormGet $ renderTable $ pure (,,)
    &lt;*&gt; areq (check (\x -&gt;
            if T.length x &lt; 3
                then Left (&quot;Need at least 3 letters&quot; :: Text)
                else Right x
              ) textField)
            &quot;Name&quot; Nothing
    &lt;*&gt; areq (checkBool (&gt;= 18) (&quot;Must be 18 or older&quot; :: Text) intField)
            &quot;Age&quot; Nothing
    &lt;*&gt; areq (checkM inPast dayField) &quot;Anniversary&quot; Nothing
  where
    inPast x = do
        now &lt;- liftIO getCurrentTime
        return $ if utctDay now &lt; x
                    then Left (&quot;Need a date in the past&quot; :: Text)
                    else Right x</pre>
  <aside class="note" id="file851-the-check-functions-x6">The type signatures on the strings are necessary due to our usage of OverloadedStrings. It
   would be nice if GHC had some defaulting rules when it gets confused, but that&#39;s not the case
   yet.</aside>
