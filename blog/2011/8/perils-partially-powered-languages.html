<h1>Let&#39;s make an ePub</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file853-lets-make-an-epub-x1">I was recently tasked with setting up a system for one of our clients that would take their
   internal XML document format and produce an ePub. This isn&#39;t a particularly difficult task, and
   is something I&#39;ve done before. The one restriction I was given was that the solution had to be
   implemented in Java.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file853-lets-make-an-epub-x2">Anyone who reads this blog at all should realize I&#39;m a Haskell programmer, and as such, Java is
   not my language of choice. Nonetheless, I&#39;m used to clients requiring work be done with it, on
   the chance that they ever want to look at the code. (To my knowledge, this has never actually
   happened.) This time around, I&#39;m very happy I did it in Java, as it gave me a perfect real-life
   situation for expressing a point I&#39;ve wanted to make for a while.</p>
 <h1>What is Java?</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file854-what-is-java-x1">Before getting into the meat of this, we need to analyze the client requirement a bit more:
   what is Java, and why do they want me to use it? There are really two distinct things that get
   the name Java: the programmer language, and the virtual machine. The requirement to use Java then
   stems from two completely different goals:</p>
  <ul id="file854-what-is-java-ul_rer_jmi_jd"><li id="file854-what-is-java-x2">Requiring Java-the-language has to do with the idea that &quot;we know Java, we&#39;ll understand Java
    code.&quot;</li>
   <li id="file854-what-is-java-x3">Requiring the JVM is usually about ease of deployment, increased security, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file854-what-is-java-x4">In this case, it was made clear that the goals were the first one: they wanted any one of their
   ten Java programmers to be able to understand the code I was writing. So in a situation like
   this, you would assume that every line of code needs to be written in Java itself, for maximum
   comprehension. (They actually mentioned a possible interest in using Clojure, but that would have
   been a stretch for them.)</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file854-what-is-java-x5">However, as you&#39;ll see in a bit, most of the code I wrote was <i id="file854-what-is-java-x6">not</i> Java, and they were
   perfectly happy with this.</p>
 <h1>Meet the Partially Powered Languages</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-x1">So if not Java, then what? Well, there were actually three additional languages used in the
   development of the project, with one of them being replaced halfway through:</p>
  <ul id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-ul_uus_ssi_jd"><li id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-x2">XSLT, used for transforming XML.</li>
   <li id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-x3">XProc, an XML pipeline language. More on this later.</li>
   <li id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-x4">Ant, used to orchestrate all this.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-x5">This list may seem a bit arbitrary, but it&#39;s not. One of the major tools used in the document
   services industry is the DITA-OT, and it is a polyglot of Java, XSLT and Ant. There is a lot of
   interest in migrating to XProc for both simplification and performance improvements, and the
   client specifically mentioned an interest in XProc since they are using it elsewhere.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-x6">Why do I call these partially powered languages? Quite simply, each language is good for its
   specific task, but can&#39;t (easily) do anything else. Take XProc: it&#39;s a language designed to piece
   together a number of XML-transforming operations. The approach often used today by tools like the
   DITA-OT is to use Ant to call out to XSLT for each pipeline step, storing the intermediate
   results in a temp folder. As you can imagine, all of that file I/O, parsing and rendering carries
   a performance penalty.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-x7">So I thought that XProc would be perfect here... until I found out there was no direct way to
   create a ZIP file from it. (ePubs are just glorified ZIP files.) This isn&#39;t a bug in XProc, or
   something for which the library has not yet been written, but simply a fact of the language: its
   goals do not include producing ZIP files. And that&#39;s precisely the problem: it&#39;s not very common
   that someones needs fit perfectly into the use case of the tool in question.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-x8">Here&#39;s another example from this project. XSLT turned out to be fairly straight-forward for
   most of the implementation. (Besides the fact that there are a whole bunch of issues with
   relative file paths waiting to rear their ugly heads... but for now, the XML is simple, so we
   took the easy route.) And using XSLT 2.0 allowed us to write this thing to generate multiple
   output files from a single input file, meaning a single XSLT call to produce all the output,
   avoiding all those temporary XML files I mentioned earlier. Hurray!</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-x9">And all was well... until I got to the end. One of the XML files in an ePub (content.opf)
   requires a list of all the files contained in the ZIP file. No problem, I can generate a list of
   all the HTML files I generated. But I don&#39;t have a list of all the static files, like CSS and
   images, that were used. In theory, I could glean all the images referenced from the XML directly,
   but I don&#39;t know about any images referenced from the CSS. And XSLT can&#39;t parse CSS, so that&#39;s
   not an option.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-x10">There&#39;s actually a very simple solution: just get a list of all the files in the static folder.
   Heck, I can use that for the HTML too if I want to be lazy! All I need to do is use that XSLT
   directory listing function... that function that doesn&#39;t exist. You see, getting a list of files
   in a folder is not in the purview of XSLT. It knows how to read, manipulate, and generate XML. So
   how did I solve this? Well, the standard way we do things in the DITA-OT:</p>
  <ol id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-ol_yxy_qwi_jd"><li id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-x11">Write some Java code that lists files in folder and outputs them as an XML file.</li>
   <li id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-x12">Call that code before calling XSLT.</li>
   <li id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-x13">Pass in a referenced to that generated file when calling the XSLT. Let XSLT do its normal
    stuff at that point.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file855-meet-the-partially-powered-languages-x14">As for Ant... well, anyone familiar with it will know its powers. It can easily do stuff like
   copy files, compile Java, and call XSLT. And it can easily be extended with new features, by
   defining new Ant tasks- in Java. Which just proves the point: it can do some stuff itself, but
   not everything.</p>
 <h1>So what&#39;s the problem?</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file856-so-whats-the-problem-x1">Just to review, let&#39;s see how our little ePub generator works:</p>
  <ol id="file856-so-whats-the-problem-ol_pvt_exi_jd"><li id="file856-so-whats-the-problem-x2">We use Ant to orchestrate everything. It&#39;s what the user calls (perhaps ironically via a Bash
    script), it accepts parameters, and calls out to everything else.</li>
   <li id="file856-so-whats-the-problem-x3">There&#39;s one piece of Java code to generate an XML file containing the list of files.</li>
   <li id="file856-so-whats-the-problem-x4">XSLT takes the input XML files and produces the XHTML and XML files required by the
    ePub.</li>
   <li id="file856-so-whats-the-problem-x5">Ant does some file copying as necessary, then ZIPs everything up into an ePub.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file856-so-whats-the-problem-x6">Doesn&#39;t seem too bad, right? Well, remember that issue with relative paths I mentioned? It&#39;s
   something I&#39;ve solved before on different projects. It&#39;s nothing too complicated, you just need
   to (1) parse file paths properly and (2) make sure you have a consistent mapping from source
   files to output files. This was really easy to solve in Haskell, and even in Java: you just use a
   datastructure like a map or hashtable and some basic string parsing.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file856-so-whats-the-problem-x7">And here&#39;s the problem: both of those are difficult to impossible in XSLT. XSLT isn&#39;t designed
   for maps. It certainly doesn&#39;t have the ability to get the canonical filename for a relative path
   and use it as a key in a dictionary. While that&#39;s just 1 or 2 lines in Java, Haskell, and
   probably a dozen other languages, it&#39;s not the case in XSLT. (By the way, this is an existing,
   long-standing bug in the DITA-OT already. The solution there is &quot;don&#39;t set up your source XML
   that way.&quot;)</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file856-so-whats-the-problem-x8">There&#39;s also the fact that this whole call-out-to-Java approach for the file listing is
   ridiculous. It&#39;s inefficient for certain, but more importantly, it&#39;s counter-intuitive. And it&#39;s
   something that can be easily broken in maintenance.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file856-so-whats-the-problem-x9">But then there&#39;s the really big issue: the whole reason to use Java was so that all of their
   Java programmers would understand the code. <b id="file856-so-whats-the-problem-x10">And we haven&#39;t achieved that goal at all.</b> The
   Java code was the most innocuous part of the project. Now in order to understand what&#39;s going on,
   they need to know Java, Ant and XSLT.</p>
  <aside class="note" id="file856-so-whats-the-problem-x11">Nonetheless, for some reason that baffles me, using XProc, XSLT and Ant is still considered
   &quot;Java&quot; by our clients. I truly can&#39;t explain this mindset, I&#39;m sorry I have no insight to
   share.</aside>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file856-so-whats-the-problem-x12">There&#39;s one more issue that I&#39;ve seen, that hasn&#39;t affected us here yet, but does affect other
   big system designed in this way: modularity. Ant and XSLT are not designed for modularity. They
   aren&#39;t general purpose languages, and they were designed with specific goals. You can see this
   limitation greatly in the DITA-OT: in needed to create an entire plugin system which generates
   Ant files from templates just to accomplish something simple like passing parameters. (It&#39;s a bit
   more complicated than that, I don&#39;t want to go into the gory details here.) And the worst part is
   that it doesn&#39;t even solve the problem well: you can&#39;t have two sets of modifications to HTML
   output in the DITA-OT without essentially duplicating all of the template files.</p>
 <h1>Why did you let this happen?</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file857-why-did-you-let-this-happen-x1">It seems like the fault in all this rests squarely on my shoulders: I knew that Ant and XSLT
   had shortcomings for this project, and I used them anyway. I should have just manned up and used
   Java for the whole thing. Everything would have been in a single language that the client can
   understand, and adding future features like better file reference support would have been an
   evolutionary change.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file857-why-did-you-let-this-happen-x2">The problem is that there&#39;s a budget to consider. I&#39;ve tried once before to replace our normal
   XSLT usage with pure Java, and the result was horrible: it took me significantly longer to write
   than just doing the same thing in XSLT. And there are two reasons for this: Java-the-language,
   and Java-the-libraries. I don&#39;t want to speak about this in the abstract, so let&#39;s have a
   real-world comparison to a Haskell library: <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xml-enumerator">xml-enumerator</a>. I&#39;m sure many
   other languages could make a similar comparison with their tools, but this is the one I&#39;m most
   familiar with.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file857-why-did-you-let-this-happen-x4">Let&#39;s start with a simple question: what&#39;s an XML document? In xml-enumerator, that&#39;s very
   simple: a <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/xml-enumerator/0.3.4/doc/html/Text-XML-Enumerator-Resolved.html#/t:Document">datatype called Document</a> that contains some stuff
   (processing instructions and comments) before and after the root element, a doctype statement,
   and the root element itself. What&#39;s an <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/xml-enumerator/0.3.4/doc/html/Text-XML-Enumerator-Resolved.html#/t:Element">element</a>? Why it&#39;s the tag name, a list of attributes and a
   list of children nodes. And a <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/xml-enumerator/0.3.4/doc/html/Text-XML-Enumerator-Resolved.html#/t:Node">node</a> is either an element, some text, a processing
   instruction, or a comment. It&#39;s all right there in the data type definitions, which I think are
   even understable by someone without any Haskell experience.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file857-why-did-you-let-this-happen-x8">Contrast this with the DOM model from Java. We have a <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/org/w3c/dom/Node.html">Node</a> interface, which has child interfaces for elements, processing
   instructions, text and comments. So far, pretty similar to Haskell. Oh, and it has subinterfaces
   for documents, attributes, and notations. (Note: notations don&#39;t actually exist in the XML.) Now,
   this Node interface declares a whole bunch of functions, such as <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/org/w3c/dom/Node.html#getNodeName()">getNodeName</a>. So you can guess what that does for an
   element, but what does it do for a comment? Well, it seems that it returns the contents of the
   comment... right.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file857-why-did-you-let-this-happen-x11">Here&#39;s some more fun: try understanding how that API deals with XML namespaces. In
   xml-enumerator, we have a special datatype called Name, that contains the local name, namespace
   and prefix for an identifier. This models the XML specification for namespaces precisely. And for
   convenience, you can even just write them as normal strings in your Haskell source code, so most
   of the time you don&#39;t even need to think about namespaces. In Java? There are two versions for
   most functions, one that deals with namespaces, and one that doesn&#39;t.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file857-why-did-you-let-this-happen-x12">Let&#39;s compare traversing the DOM. In Haskell, I can easily add an attribute to every element in
   a tree like
   so:<pre class="codeblock" id="file857-why-did-you-let-this-happen-x13">addAttr :: Name -&gt; Text -&gt; Node -&gt; Node
addAttr name value (NodeElement (Element tag attrs children)) =
    NodeElement (Element tag ((name, value) : attrs) (map (addAttr name value) children))
addAttr _ _ node = node</pre>Here,
   we get to leverage pattern matching extensively, as well as use persistent data structures
   easily. The equivalent in Java
   is:<pre class="codeblock" id="file857-why-did-you-let-this-happen-x14">public static void addAttr(String name, String value, Node node) {
    if (node.getNodeType() != Node.ELEMENT_NODE) return;
    Element element = (Element) node;
    element.setAttribute(name, value);

    NodeList nl = element.getChildNodes();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; nl.getLength(); ++i) {
        addAttr(name, value, nl.item(i));
    }
}</pre>Note
   that we have to use a type cast, which if not checked correctly could result in a runtime
   exception. We&#39;re also modifying the original value instead of generating a new one, and we have
   no support for namespaces.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file857-why-did-you-let-this-happen-x15">The magic features that&#39;s missing here is sum types. There is no good replacement in Java, and
   it precisely the right tool to model nodes in XML. Added to that the requirement to use mutable
   data structures here and it&#39;s painful. And don&#39;t even get me started on the difference between a
   null string and an empty string in the API.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file857-why-did-you-let-this-happen-x16">I&#39;ve only scratched the surface here, but I&#39;m sure you can extrapolate from here how painful
   writing this kind of code is in Java. And I was surprised to find this out: Java is after all
   known for its <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/eaqgk">prowess as manipulating XML</a>.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file857-why-did-you-let-this-happen-x18">Which now explains the situation fully: Java is a painful language for the majority of the code
   we need to write. So instead, we use a bunch of languages designed for those specific tasks to
   avoid writing that Java code. As a result, we have messy codebases using lots of sub-powered
   languages that results in spaghetti code that no one can read.</p>
 <h1>So... we should only use full-fledged languages?</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file858-so-we-should-only-use-full-fledged-languages-x1">You might think that I&#39;m advocating never using a non-general-purpose programming language.
   That&#39;s not the case. If you look at Yesod, we have a number of those floating around, in
   particular Hamlet, an HTML templating language. Let&#39;s compare Hamlet to XSLT in the context of
   this conversation:</p>
  <ul id="file858-so-we-should-only-use-full-fledged-languages-ul_jhv_jej_jd"><li id="file858-so-we-should-only-use-full-fledged-languages-x2">Hamlet is nothing more than simple, syntactic sugar. You can easily trace everything it does
    into the corresponding Haskell code. XSLT, on the other hand, is a very powerful language, for
    which it is very difficult to reproduce features in Java.</li>
   <li id="file858-so-we-should-only-use-full-fledged-languages-x3">Hamlet only has meaning within the context of a Haskell program. It reads variables from the
    surrounding code and returns a value, which must be used by Haskell. XSLT can exist entirely
    outside of a Java program.</li>
   <li id="file858-so-we-should-only-use-full-fledged-languages-x4">Hamlet has absolutely no side effects. XSLT can be used to generate as many output files as
    it wants.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file858-so-we-should-only-use-full-fledged-languages-x5">You might be surprised at what I&#39;m saying: Hamlet&#39;s advantage is that it&#39;s <b id="file858-so-we-should-only-use-full-fledged-languages-x6">less</b> powerful
   than XSLT! That&#39;s precisely the point. Having add-on languages like Hamlet are great for
   simplifying code, removing line noise, and making it easier to maintain the codebase. XSLT, on
   the other hand, is used as an alternative to Java.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file858-so-we-should-only-use-full-fledged-languages-x7">Going back to my file reference example: with a language like Hamlet, there&#39;s no problem. We
   can call back to Haskell to handle the heavy lifting that Hamlet doesn&#39;t support. It&#39;s so tightly
   bound with the surrounding program that there is virtually no overhead to this. Also, there would
   be no problem using the strong data types we know and love within Hamlet; in XSLT, we&#39;re forced
   to switch back to weak datatypes. (Example: my Java code uses the File type for getting the file
   listing; XSLT just sees strings.)</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file858-so-we-should-only-use-full-fledged-languages-x8">If I was to write an ePub generator in Haskell (which I&#39;ll likely be doing in the
   not-too-distant future), I would use the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xml-hamlet">xml-hamlet</a> package. That would allow
   me to easily and concisely produce XML values. In other words, I could
   replace:<pre class="codeblock" id="file858-so-we-should-only-use-full-fledged-languages-x10">[ NodeElement $ Element &quot;foo&quot; [(&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;)]
    [ NodeContent &quot;some content&quot;
    , NodeElement $ Element &quot;bin&quot; [] []
    ]
]</pre>with<pre class="codeblock" id="file858-so-we-should-only-use-full-fledged-languages-x11">[xml|
&lt;foo bar=baz&gt;
    some content
    &lt;bin&gt;
|]</pre>Of
   course, both of those are infinitely more pleasant than the Java
   equivalent:<pre class="codeblock" id="file858-so-we-should-only-use-full-fledged-languages-x12">DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
DocumentBuilder db = dbf.newDocumentBuilder();
Document doc = db.newDocument();
Element foo = doc.createElement(&quot;foo&quot;);
doc.appendChild(foo);
foo.setAttribute(&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;);
foo.appendChild(doc.createTextNode(&quot;some content&quot;));
foo.appendChild(doc.createElement(&quot;bin&quot;));</pre>And
   just wait till you have to write this to a file. In Haskell, it&#39;s the <code id="file858-so-we-should-only-use-full-fledged-languages-x13">writeFile</code>
   function. In Java, I pity you.</p>
