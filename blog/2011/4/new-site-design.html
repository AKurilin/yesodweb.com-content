<p>A huge thanks to <a href="http://chrisdone.com/">Chris Done</a>, who has put together a new design for the Yesod site. I'm sure there's a few kinks to be worked out, plus a possible bug or two since we're now running on the Yesod 0.8 beta release, so please let us know if you notice anything strange.</p>
<p>Also, I wanted to let everyone know that I'm really getting to work on the book this week. I've done some cleanup of a few chapters, plus added the beginning of the <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/book/subsite">subsite chapter</a> (I only mention that in particular because there was particular demand for it).</p>
<p>I'm hoping that the remainder of this week will stay focused on writing the book, so if there's any section in particular you wish was already written, now's the time to speak up.</p>
