<p>My <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Yesod">talk on Yesod</a> at QCon SF was just posted by InfoQ, hope you enjoy!</p>
<p>Also, I've started to revise the book based on some reviewer feedback. I've added in an <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/book/haskell">extra chapter covering some of the Haskell features we use in Yesod</a>, such as Template Haskell, as well as revised the <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/book/basics">basics chapter</a> to demystify some of the magic that the code generation is performing. I'd appreciate people's thoughts on this move.</p>
