A few weeks ago, following up on a post by Clint Moore, I
[wrote on Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/116553865628071717889/posts/Tmx7pdtV8cU)
that we should start an intermediate Haskell book as a community. The reaction
was very positive, and it seems like something people are really looking
forward to both working on and benefiting from. I started a [Github repo](https://github.com/mezzohaskell/mezzohaskell)
and added a README describing the project.

There are still some questions about both what the content of such a book would be, and the writing style. To hopefully kickstart some discussion of the matter, I put together three sample chapters:

* [File hash example](https://github.com/mezzohaskell/mezzohaskell/blob/master/chapters/examples/filehash.md)
* [Typeclass extensions](https://github.com/mezzohaskell/mezzohaskell/tree/master/chapters/language)
* [Tools](https://github.com/mezzohaskell/mezzohaskell/blob/master/chapters/tools.md)

I specifically chose these three topics, as I think they cover the three main
types of content we want in this book: recommended libraries, the language
itself, and practices surrounding the language.

At this point, I would like to ask the community to tear these chapters apart
as much as possible. Not so much for the technical content, but for the
teaching approach. Should the filehash example have started with the "wrong
way," or jumped straight to the correct approach? Should the typeclass chapter
follow motivating examples, or describe the features first? Should the tools
chapter walk the user through typical usage scenarios, or simply state the
purpose of each tool?

I really believe that as a community we can produce a top-notch book that will
make it easier for Haskellers to move from novice to advanced.

Also, I think Mezzo Haskell is a good codename for the book: it makes clear
that this is an intermediate book, covering neither the basics nor the truly
advanced concepts. But I'm not opposed to either giving the book a longer
title, or replacing that name entirely.
