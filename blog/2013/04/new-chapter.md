Just a heads-up: I've written a new chapter for the [upcoming 1.2 version of
the book](http://www.yesodweb.com/book-1.2). The purpose of this chapter is to
help explain how a request is processed in Yesod, start to finish. It is based
around the simplified design in Yesod 1.2, and incorporates much of the
information I put in the 1.2 blog posts.

Comments, questions and criticism are very welcome! You can [view the chapter
on the site](http://www.yesodweb.com/book-1.2/understanding-request). If you'd
like to submit pull requests, you can [see the source on
Github](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesodweb.com-content/tree/master/book/chapters).
