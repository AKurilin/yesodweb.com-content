I'm also announcing the last call for input for the Yesod 1.2 release. The
Yesod team has decided to make this release on Thursday, May 2, unless there is
new input from the community. If you want to play with it before release,
please install from Github:

```
cabal update
git clone https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod
cd yesod
cabal-meta install
```

If you run into any problems, or have any questions, please raise them on the
mailing list or the IRC channel.

As a reminder, you can see the upcoming changes for Yesod 1.2 in [the
changelog](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/wiki/Changelog#yesod-12-not-yet-released)
