[Yesterday I said](http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2013/12/book-updates-1-2) that
the Yesod book was almost fully updated for version 1.2, and that I'd let
everyone know when it was completely updated. Turns out that the last chapter
took far less time to update than I'd expected. So I'm happy to announce that
the Yesod book is now fully revised and up-to-date with version 1.2 of Yesod.
The final chapter [on using
Sphinx](http://www.yesodweb.com/book/case-study-sphinx) is now available, and
benefitted greatly from the simplified streaming data primitives introduced in
Yesod 1.2.
