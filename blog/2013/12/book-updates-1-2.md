Over the past week, I've been busy updating the Yesod book for version 1.2. I'm
happy to announce that this process is *almost* complete. The only chapter left
to be updated is the Sphinx example. Of particular note, I'd like to point
people at the [Wiki/chat subsite
example](http://www.yesodweb.com/book/wiki-chat-example), which has been
substantially updated to reflect changes in Yesod 1.2's subsite handling. This
chapter gives a pretty good overview of a decently complex application, so I
recommend people trying to get a better grasp of Yesod's type system check it
out.

I'm going to continue working on the Sphinx example, and will post when it's
available. After that, I'm planning on adding new content to the book. For now,
my plans are focused on a few new examples. Here are the ideas I've come up
with so far:

* JSON serving
* Using Fay for client side development
* Providing streaming data via respondSource
* Initializing data to be put into the foundation datatype
* Getting configuration information from environment variables

I'm open to input for other ideas for examples. Also, if anyone can think of
content that's lacking in the rest of the book, please let me know. Now's the
time to fill in any missing pieces.
