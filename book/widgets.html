Worse still, we have to place these components in different locations on the page: CSS in a style tag in the head, Javascript in a script tag in the head, and HTML in the body. And never mind if you want to put your CSS and Javascript in separate files!</p><p class="hascomments" id="file53-widgets/i2">In practice, this works out fairly nicely when building a single page, because we can separate our structure (HTML), styling (CSS) and logic (Javascript). But when we want to build modular pieces of code that can be easily composed, it can be a headache to coordinate all three pieces separately. Widgets are Yesod&#39;s solution to the problem. They also help with the issue of including libraries, such as jQuery, one time only.</p><p class="hascomments" id="file53-widgets/i3">Our four template languages- Hamlet, Cassius, Lucius and Julius- provide the raw tools for constructing your output.

 </section><section class="subtopic" id="file45-whats-in-a-widget"><h1>What&#39;s in a Widget?</h1><p class="hascomments" id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/ww1">At a very superficial level, an HTML document is just a
            bunch of nested tags. This is the approach most HTML generation
            tools take: you simply define hierarchies of tags and are done with
            it. But let&#39;s imagine that I want to write a component of a page
            for displaying the navbar. I want this to be &quot;plug and play&quot;: I
            simply call the function at the right time, and the navbar is
            inserted at the correct point in the hierarchy.</p><p class="hascomments" id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/ww2">This is where our superficial HTML generation breaks down.
            Our navbar likely consists of some CSS and JavaScript in addition
            to HTML. By the time we call the navbar function, we have already
            rendered the &lt;head&gt; tag, so it is too late to add a new
            &lt;style&gt; tag for our CSS declarations. Under normal
            strategies, we would need to break up our navbar function into
            three parts: HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and make sure that we always
            call all three pieces.</p><p class="hascomments" id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/ww3">Widgets take a different approach. Instead of viewing an
            HTML document as a monolithic tree of tags, widgets see a number of
            distinct components in the page. In particular:</p><ul id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/x1"><li id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/x2">The title</li><li id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/x3">External stylesheets</li><li id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/x4">External Javascript</li><li id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/x5">CSS declarations</li><li id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/x6">Javascript code</li><li id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/x7">Arbitrary &lt;head&gt; content</li><li id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/x8">Arbitrary &lt;body&gt; content</li></ul><p class="hascomments" id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/ww4">Different components have different semantics. For example,
            there can only be one title, but there can be multiple external
            scripts and stylesheets. However, those external scripts and
            stylesheets should only be included once. Arbitrary head and body
            content, on the other hand, has no limitation (someone may want to
            have five lorem ipsum blocks after all).</p><p class="hascomments" id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/ww5">The job of a widget is to hold onto these disparate
            components and apply proper logic for combining different widgets
            together. This consists of things like taking the first title set
            and ignoring others, applying <code id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/x9">nub</code> to the list of
            external scripts and stylesheets, and simply concatenating head and
            body content.</p><aside class="note" id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/x10"><p class="hascomments" id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/ww6">In general, you should avoid nub since it has very bad
                performance. Usually when you are looking for uniqueness, you
                do not care about order, and therefore <code id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/x11">map head . group .  sort</code>
                is more efficient than a call to nub. However,
                in our case, order <i id="file45-whats-in-a-widget/x12">is</i> important: we would not want to
                include jQuery UI before we include jQuery. Therefore, we are
                stuck with nub.</p></aside></section><section class="subtopic" id="file46-constructing-widgets"><h1>Constructing Widgets</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file46-constructing-widgets/x1">In order to use widgets, you&#39;ll obviously need to be able to get your hands on them. The most
   common way will be via the ToWidget typeclass, and its toWidget method. This allows you to
   convert your Shakespearean templates directly to a Widget: Hamlet code will appear in the body,
   Julius scripts inside a &lt;script&gt; tag in the head, and Cassius and Lucius in a &lt;style&gt;
   tag.</p>
  <aside class="note" id="file46-constructing-widgets/x2">You can actually override the default behavior and have the script and style code appear in
   a separate file. The scaffolded site provides this for you automatically.</aside>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file46-constructing-widgets/x3">But what if you want to add some &lt;meta&gt; tags, which need to appear in the head? Or if you
   want some Javascript to appear in the body instead of the head? For these purposes, Yesod
   provides two additional type classes: ToWidgetHead and ToWidgetBody. These work exactly as they
   seem they should.</p>
  <aside class="note" id="file46-constructing-widgets/x4">There is no ToWidgetBody instance for Lucius and Cassius, since you can&#39;t put a style tag in
   the body.</aside>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file46-constructing-widgets/x5">In addition, there are a number of other functions for creating specific kinds of Widgets:</p>
  <dl id="file46-constructing-widgets/x6">
   
    <dt id="file46-constructing-widgets/x8">setTitle</dt>
    <dd id="file46-constructing-widgets/x9">Turns some HTML into the page title.</dd>
   
   
    <dt id="file46-constructing-widgets/x11">addCassiusMedia, addLuciusMedia</dt>
    <dd id="file46-constructing-widgets/x12">Works the same as toWidget, but takes an additional parameter to indicate what kind of media
     this applies to. Useful for creating print stylesheets, for instance.</dd>
   
   
    <dt id="file46-constructing-widgets/x14">addStylesheet</dt>
    <dd id="file46-constructing-widgets/x15">Adds a reference, via a &lt;link&gt; tag, to an external stylesheet. Takes a type-safe
     URL.</dd>
   
   
    <dt id="file46-constructing-widgets/x17">addStylesheetRemote</dt>
    <dd id="file46-constructing-widgets/x18">Same as addStylesheet, but takes a normal URL. Useful for referring to files hosted on a
     CDN, like Google&#39;s jQuery UI CSS files.</dd>
   
   
    <dt id="file46-constructing-widgets/x20">addScript</dt>
    <dd id="file46-constructing-widgets/x21">Adds a reference, via a &lt;script&gt; tag, to an external script. Takes a type-safe URL.</dd>

  <p class="hascomments" id="file47-combining-widgets/x1">The whole idea of widgets is to increase composability. You can easily take these individual pieces of
   HTML, CSS and Javascript, combine them together into something more complicated, and then combine
   these larger entities into complete pages. This all works naturally through the Monad instance of
   Widgets, meaning you can just use do-notation to compose pieces together.</p>

   or a Writer monad to build things up. In my experience, it&#39;s easiest and most natural to just use
   do-notation.</aside>

   approach to perform complex actions, like database queries, from within a widget. We&#39;ll cover

  <p class="hascomments" id="file50-whamlet/x1">Let&#39;s say you&#39;ve got a fairly standard Hamlet template, that embeds another Hamlet template to
   represent the footer:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock" id="file50-whamlet/x2">page = [hamlet|
&lt;p&gt;This is my page. I hope you enjoyed it.
^{footer}

footer = [hamlet|

|]</pre>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file50-whamlet/x3">That works fine if the footer is plain old HTML, but what if we want to add some style? Well,
   we can easily spice up the footer by turning it into a Widget:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock" id="file50-whamlet/x4">footer = do
    toWidget [lucius| footer { font-weight: bold; text-align: center } |]

  <p class="hascomments" id="file50-whamlet/x5">But now we&#39;ve got a problem: a Hamlet template can only embed another Hamlet template; it knows
   nothing about a Widget. This is where whamlet comes in. It takes exactly the same syntax as
   normal Hamlet, and variable (#{...}) and URL (@{...}) interpolation are unchanged. But embedding
   (^{...}) takes a widget, and the final result is a widget. To use it, we can just do:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock" id="file50-whamlet/x6">page = [whamlet|
&lt;p&gt;This is my page. I hope you enjoyed it.
^{footer}

      which will also include your Lucius, Cassius, and Julius files automatically. We&#39;ll cover that
      in the <a href="../../../topics/yesod-web-framework-book/scaffolding-and-the-site-template/scaffolding-and-the-site-template.html#file166-scaffolding-and-the-site-templatescaffolding">scaffolding chapter</a>.</aside>
 <section class="subtopic" id="file49-types"><h1>Types</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file49-types/x1">You may have noticed that I&#39;ve been avoiding type signatures so far. That&#39;s because there&#39;s a
   little bit of a complication involved here. At the most basic level, all you need to know is that
   the scaffolded site defines a type synonym called Widget which you will almost always use. The
   technical details follow, but don&#39;t worry if it&#39;s a little hazy.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file49-types/x2">Earlier, we said that a Widget is a monad transformer around a Handler. Well, that&#39;s mostly
   true, but we actually have a little more flexibility than that. We have a base datatype:
    <code id="file49-types/x3">GGWidget master monad a</code>. The first parameter is the master site&#39;s foundation
   datatype. We&#39;ll be covering the difference between master and subsites in much more detail later,
   but for now, suffice it to say that the master foundation type is what uniquely represents your
   application.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file49-types/x4">The second parameter is the inner monad. This in theory could be any monad, but as we&#39;ll see
   soon, it&#39;s almost always a Handler. Finally, the last parameter is the value contained by the
   GGWidget (remember, a GGWidget is a Monad).</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file49-types/x5">In practice, you will almost never see a GGWidget; that extra flexibility is really only needed
   internally to Yesod. What you will bump into occassionally is the GWidget, defined as
    <code id="file49-types/x6">type GWidget sub master = GGWidget master (GHandler sub master)</code>. This spells
   out that our GWidget has a subsite and master site foundation (explained in a second), and that
   the inner monad is a GHandler, using the same sub and master sites.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file49-types/x7">So what&#39;s the deal with that sub/master stuff? Well, when you&#39;re writing some reusable code,
   such as a CRUD application, you can write it as a subsite that can be embedded within any other
   Yesod application. In such a case, we need to keep track of information for both the sub and
   master sites. The simplest example is for the type-safe URLs: Yesod needs to know how to take a
   route for your CRUD subsite and turn it into a route for the master site so that it can be
   properly rendered.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file49-types/x8">However, that sub/master distinction only ever matters when you&#39;re interacting with subsites.
   When you&#39;re writing your standard response code, you&#39;re dealing with just your application, and
   so the sub and master sites will be the same. Since this is the most common case, the scaffolded
   site declares a type synonym to help you out. Let&#39;s say your foundation type is MyCoolApp, it
   will define <code id="file49-types/x9">type Widget = GWidget MyCoolApp MyCoolApp ()</code>. Therefore, we can get
   some very user-friendly type signatures on our widgets:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock" id="file49-types/x10">footer :: Widget
footer = do
    toWidget [lucius| footer { font-weight: bold; text-align: center } |]
    toWidget [hamlet|
&lt;footer&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That&#39;s all folks!
|]

page :: Widget
page = [whamlet|
&lt;p&gt;This is my page. I hope you enjoyed it.
^{footer}
|]</pre>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file49-types/x11">And in case you were wondering: we have an almost identical breakdown for the Handler
   datatypes: a less-used GGHandler, GHandler and finally a per-application Handler, defined as
    <code id="file49-types/x12">type Handler = GHandler MyCoolApp MyCoolApp</code>.</p>
 </section></section><section class="subtopic" id="file51-using-widgets"><h1>Using Widgets</h1>  <p class="hascomments" id="file51-using-widgets/x1">It&#39;s all well and good that we have these beautiful Widget datatypes, but how exactly
            do we turn them into something the user can interact with? The most commonly used
            function is defaultLayout, which essentially has the type signature <code id="file51-using-widgets/x2">Widget -&gt; Handler RepHtml</code>. (I say &quot;essentially&quot; because of the whole
            GHandler issue.) RepHtml is a datatype containing some raw HTML output ready to be sent
            over the wire.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file51-using-widgets/x3">defaultLayout is actually a typeclass method, which can be overridden for each application.
   This is how Yesod apps are themed. So we&#39;re still left with the question: when we&#39;re inside
   defaultLayout, how do we unwrap a Widget? The answer is widgetToPageContent. Let&#39;s look at some
   (simplified) types:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock" id="file51-using-widgets/x4">widgetToPageContent :: Widget -&gt; Handler (PageContent url)
data PageContent url = PageContent
    { pageTitle :: Html
    , pageHead :: HtmlUrl url
    , pageBody :: HtmlUrl url
    }</pre>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file51-using-widgets/x5">This is getting closer to what we need. We now have direct access to the HTML making up the
   head and body, as well as the title. At this point, we can use Hamlet to combine them all
   together into a single document, along with our site layout, and we use hamletToRepHtml to render
   that Hamlet result into actual HTML that&#39;s ready to be shown to the user.</p>

  <p class="hascomments" id="file52-summary/x-3">The basic building block of each page is a widget. Individual snippets of HTML, CSS, and
   Javascript can be turned into widgets via the polymorphic <code id="file52-summary/x-4">toWidget</code> function.
   Using do-notation, you can combine these individual widgets into larger widgets, eventually
   containing all the content of your page.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file52-summary/x-5">Unwrapping these widgets is usually performed within the defaultLayout function, which can be
   used to apply a unified look-and-feel to all your pages.</p>
