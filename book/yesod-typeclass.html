So far, we&#39;ve only seen the approot method, with the cryptic definition <code id="file65-yesod-typeclass/x1">approot _ = &quot;&quot;</code>, and defaultLayout. In this chapter, we&#39;ll explore the meaning of the approot method, along with many other methods in the Yesod typeclass.</p><p class="hascomments" id="file65-yesod-typeclass/i2">The Yesod typeclass gives us a central place for defining settings for our application. Excluding the approot method, everything else has a default definition which is usually the right thing. But in order to build a powerful, customized application, you&#39;ll usually end up overriding at least a few of these methods.</p><section class="subtopic" id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls"><h1>Rendering and Parsing URLs</h1><p class="hascomments" id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/rpu1">We&#39;ve already mentioned how Yesod is able to automatically render type-safe URLs into a textual URL that can be inserted into an HTML page. Let&#39;s say we have a route definition that looks like:</p><pre class="codeblock" id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/x1">mkYesod &quot;MyApp&quot; [parseRoutes|
/some/path SomePathR GET
]</pre><p class="hascomments" id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/rpu2">If we place SomePathR into a hamlet template, how does Yesod render it? Yesod always tries to construct <i id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/x2">absolute</i> URLs. This is especially useful once we start creating XML sitemaps and Atom feeds, or sending emails. But in order to construct an absolute URL, we need to know the domain name of the application.</p><p class="hascomments" id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/rpu3">You might think to just get that information from the user&#39;s request, but we still need to deal with ports. And even if we get the port number from the request, are we using HTTP or HTTPS? And even if you know <i id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/x3">that</i>, such an approach would break one of our RESTful principles: depending on how the user submitted a request would generate different URLs. For example, we would generate different URLs depending if the user connected to &quot;example.com&quot; or &quot;www.example.com&quot;.</p><p class="hascomments" id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/rpu4">And finally, Yesod doesn&#39;t make any assumption about <i id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/x4">where</i> you host your application. For example, I may have a mostly static site (http://static.example.com/), but I&#39;d like to stick a Yesod-powered Wiki at /wiki/. There is no reliable way for an application to determine what subpath it is being hosted from. So instead of doing all of this guesswork, Yesod needs you to tell it the <dfn id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/x5">application root</dfn>.</p><p class="hascomments" id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/rpu5">So using the wiki example, you would write your Yesod instance as:</p><pre class="codeblock" id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/x6">instance Yesod MyWiki where approot _ = &quot;http://static.example.com/wiki&quot;</pre><p class="hascomments" id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/rpu6">Notice that there is no trailing slash there. Next, when Yesod wants to construct a URL for SomePathR, it determines that the relative path for SomePathR is &quot;/some/path&quot;, appends that to your approot and creates &quot;http://static.example.com/wiki/some/path&quot;.</p><p class="hascomments" id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/rpu7">This also explains our cryptic <code id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/x7">approot _ = &quot;&quot;</code>: for our examples in the book, we&#39;re always serving from the root of the domain (in our case, localhost). By using an empty string, SomePathR renders to &quot;/some/path&quot;, which works just fine. In real life applications, however, you should use a real application root.</p>
<aside class="note" id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/x13">The first argument to approot is the site foundation. This means that you could load your approot at program initialization, store it in the foundation, and then retrieve it. This is in fact what the scaffolded site does, using a YAML config file.</aside>
<p class="hascomments" id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/rpu8">And by the way, the site template generated by the scaffolding tool automatically uses conditional compilation to switch between development and production builds, so you can easily test on one domain- like localhost- and serve from a different domain.</p><aside class="note" id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/x8"><p class="hascomments" id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/rpu9">You might be wondering: why does approot take that first argument if it is always ignored? There are two reasons:</p><ul id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/x9"><li id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/x10">It is needed by Haskell&#39;s type system to determine which instance of Yesod to use for grabbing the typeclass.</li><li id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/x11">And actually, the first argument is <i id="file56-rendering-and-parsing-urls/x12">not</i> always ignored. For example, if you want to load the application root value from a configuration file, the most logical place to store that value is in the foundation datatype, and then for the approot function to grab the value from there.</li></ul></aside><section class="subtopic" id="file54-joinpath"><h1>joinPath</h1><p class="hascomments" id="file54-joinpath/jp1">In order to convert a type-safe URL into a text value, Yesod uses two helper functions. The first is the <code id="file54-joinpath/x1">renderRoute</code> method of the <code id="file54-joinpath/x2">RenderRoute</code> typeclass. Every type-safe URL is an instance of this typeclass. <code id="file54-joinpath/x3">renderRoute</code> simply converts a value into a list of path pieces. For example, our <code id="file54-joinpath/x4">SomePathR</code> from above would be converted into [&quot;some&quot;, &quot;path&quot;].</p><aside class="note" id="file54-joinpath/x5"><p class="hascomments" id="file54-joinpath/jp2">Actually, renderRoute produces both the path pieces and a list of query-string parameters. The default instances of renderRoute always provide an empty list of query string parameters. However, it is possible to override this. One notable case is the static subsite, which puts a hash of the file contents in the query string for caching purposes.</p></aside><p class="hascomments" id="file54-joinpath/jp3">The other function is the <code id="file54-joinpath/x6">joinPath</code> method of the Yesod typeclass. This function takes the four arguments: the foundation value, the application root, a list of path segments and a list of query string parameters, and returns a textual URL. The default implementation does the &quot;right thing&quot;: it separates the path pieces by forward slashes, prepends the application root and appends the query string.</p><p class="hascomments" id="file54-joinpath/jp4">If you are happy with default URL rendering, you should not need to modify it. However, if you want to modify URL rendering to do things like append a trailing slash, this would be the place to do it.</p></section><section class="subtopic" id="file55-cleanpath"><h1>cleanPath</h1><p class="hascomments" id="file55-cleanpath/cp1">The flip side to <code id="file55-cleanpath/x1">joinPath</code> is <code id="file55-cleanpath/x2">cleanPath</code>. Let&#39;s look at how it gets used in the dispatch process:</p><ol id="file55-cleanpath/x3"><li id="file55-cleanpath/x4">The path info requested by the user is split into a series of path pieces.</li><li id="file55-cleanpath/x5">If any prefix of the path pieces matches a subsite, then dispatching is passed off to the subsite.</li><li id="file55-cleanpath/x6">Otherwise, we pass the path pieces to the cleanPath function.</li><li id="file55-cleanpath/x7">If cleanPath indicates a redirect (a Left response), then a 301 response is sent to the client. This is used to force canonical URLs (eg, remove extra slashes).</li><li id="file55-cleanpath/x8">Otherwise, we try to dispatch to our non-subsite routes using the response from cleanPath (a Right). If this works, we return a response. Otherwise, we return a 404.</li></ol><p class="hascomments" id="file55-cleanpath/cp2">This combination allows subsites to retain full control of how their URLs appear, yet allows master sites to have modified URLs. As a simple example, let&#39;s see how we could modify Yesod to always produce trailing slashes on URLs:</p><pre class="codeblock" id="file55-cleanpath/x9">-- START

</pre><p class="hascomments" id="file55-cleanpath/cp3">First, let&#39;s look at our joinPath implementation. This is copied almost verbatim from
            the default Yesod implementation, with one difference: we append an extra empty string
            to the end. When dealing with path pieces, an empty string will simply append another
            slash. So adding an extra empty string will force a trailing slash.</p><p class="hascomments" id="file55-cleanpath/cp4">cleanPath is a little bit trickier. First, we check for the empty path like before, and if so pass it through as-is. We use Right to indicate that a redirect is not necessary. The next clause is actually checking for two different possible URL issues:</p><ul id="file55-cleanpath/x11"><li id="file55-cleanpath/x12">There is a double slash, which would show up as an empty string in the middle of our paths.</li><li id="file55-cleanpath/x13">There is a missing trailing slash, which would show up as the last piece not being an empty string.</li></ul><p class="hascomments" id="file55-cleanpath/cp5">Assuming neither of those conditions hold, then only the last piece is empty, and we should dispatch based on all but the last piece. However, if this is not the case, we want to redirect to a canonical URL. In this case, we strip out all empty pieces and do not bother appending a trailing slash, since joinPath will do that for us.</p></section></section><section class="subtopic" id="file58-defaultlayout"><h1>defaultLayout</h1><p class="hascomments" id="file58-defaultlayout/dl1">Most websites like to apply some general template to all of their pages. defaultLayout is the recommended approach for this.

  <aside class="note" id="file60-conceptId/in-scaffolding">The functionality described here is automatically included in the
   scaffolded site.</aside>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file60-conceptId/x-3">One of the most powerful, and most intimidating, methods in the Yesod typeclass is
    <code id="file60-conceptId/x-4">addStaticContent</code>. Remember that a Widget consists of multiple components,
   including CSS and Javascript. How exactly does that CSS/JS arrive in the user&#39;s browser? By
   default, they are served in the &lt;head&gt; of the page, inside &lt;style&gt; and &lt;script&gt; tags,
   respectively.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file60-conceptId/x-5">That might be simple, but it&#39;s far from efficient. Every page load will now require loading up
   the CSS/JS from scratch, even if nothing changed! What we really want is to store this content in
   an external file and then refer to it from the HTML.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file60-conceptId/x-6">This is where addStaticContent comes in. It takes three arguments: the filename extension of
   the content (&quot;css&quot; or &quot;js&quot;), the mime-type of the content (&quot;text/css&quot; or &quot;text/javascript&quot;) and
   the content itself. It will then return one of three possible results:</p>
  <dl id="file60-conceptId/x-7">
   
    <dt id="file60-conceptId/x-9">Nothing</dt>
    <dd id="file60-conceptId/x-10">No static file saving occurred; embed this content directly in the HTML. This is the default
     behavior.</dd>
   
   
    <dt id="file60-conceptId/x-12">Just (Left Text)</dt>
    <dd id="file60-conceptId/x-13">This content was saved in an external file, and use the given textual link to refer to
     it.</dd>
   
   
    <dt id="file60-conceptId/x-15">Just (Right (Route a, Query))</dt>
    <dd id="file60-conceptId/x-16">Same, but now use a type-safe URL along with some query string parameters.</dd>
   
  </dl>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file60-conceptId/x-17">The Left result is useful if you want to store your static files on an external server, such as
   a CDN or memory-backed server. The Right result is more commonly used, and ties in very well with
   the static subsite. This is the recommended approach for most applications, and is provided by
   the scaffolded site by default.</p>
  <aside class="note" id="file60-conceptId/x-18">You might be wondering: if this is the recommended approach, why isn&#39;t it the default? The
   problem is that it makes a number of assumptions that don&#39;t universally hold: your application
   has a static subsite, and the location of your static files.</aside>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file60-conceptId/x-19">The scaffolded addStaticContent does a number of intelligent things to help you out:</p>
  <ul id="file60-conceptId/ul_vlr_nmg_sd">
   <li id="file60-conceptId/x-20">It automatically minifies your Javascript using the <dfn class="apiname" id="file60-conceptId/x-21">hjsmin</dfn> package.</li>
   <li id="file60-conceptId/x-22">It names the output files based on a hash of the file contents. This means you can set your
    cache headers to far in the future without fears of stale content.</li>
   <li id="file60-conceptId/x-23">Also, since filenames are based on hashes, you can be guaranteed that a file doesn&#39;t need to
    be written if a file with the same name already exists. The scaffold code automatically checks
    for the existance of that file, and avoids the costly disk I/O of a write if it&#39;s not
    necessary.</li>

 </section><section class="subtopic" id="file61-smarter-static-files"><h1>Smarter Static Files</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file61-smarter-static-files/x-3">Google recommends an important optimization: <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/request.html#ServeFromCookielessDomain">serve static files from a separate domain</a>. The advantage
   to this approach is that cookies set on your main domain are not sent when retrieving static
   files, thus saving on a bit of bandwidth.</p>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file61-smarter-static-files/x-5">To facilitate this, we have the <code id="file61-smarter-static-files/x-6">urlRenderOverride</code> method. This method
   intercepts the normal URL rendering and sets a special value for some routes. For example, the
   scaffolding defines this method as:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock" id="file61-smarter-static-files/x-7">    urlRenderOverride y (StaticR s) =
        Just $ uncurry (joinPath y (Settings.staticRoot $ settings y)) $ renderRoute s
    urlRenderOverride _ _ = Nothing</pre>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file61-smarter-static-files/x-8">This means that static routes are served from a special static root, which you can configure to
   be a different domain. This is a great example of the power and flexibility of type-safe URLs:
   with a single line of code you&#39;re able to change the rendering of static routes throughout all of
   your handlers.</p>
 </section><section class="subtopic" id="file62-auth"><h1>Authentication/Authorization</h1>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file62-auth/x-4">For simple applications, checking permissions inside each handler function can be a simple,
   convenient approach. However, it doesn&#39;t scale well. Eventually, you&#39;re going to want to have a
   more declarative approach. Many systems our there define ACLs, special config files, and a lot of
   other hocus-pocus. In Yesod, it&#39;s just plain old Haskell. There are three very simple methods
   involved:</p>

     follows RESTful principles, and assumes GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE requests are read-only,
     while all others are can write.</dd>
   
   
    <dt id="file62-auth/x-10">isAuthorized</dt>
    <dd id="file62-auth/x-11">Takes a route (i.e., type-safe URL) and a boolean indicating whether or not the request is a
     write request. It returns an AuthResult, which can have one of three values:<ul id="file62-auth/ul_tsw_jog_sd">
      <li id="file62-auth/x-12">Authorized</li>
      <li id="file62-auth/x-13">AuthenticationRequired</li>
      <li id="file62-auth/x-14">Unauthorized</li>
     </ul>By default, this returns Authorized for all requests.</dd>
   
   
    <dt id="file62-auth/x-16">authRoute</dt>
    <dd id="file62-auth/x-17">If isAuthorized returns AuthenticationRequired, then redirect to the given route. If no
     route is provided (the default), return a 403 &quot;Permission Denied&quot; message.</dd>
   
  </dl>
  <p class="hascomments" id="file62-auth/x-18">These methods tie in very well with the <dfn class="apiname" id="file62-auth/x-19">yesod-auth</dfn> package, which is used by
   the scaffolded site to provide a number of authentication options, such as OpenID, BrowserID,
   email, username and Twitter. We&#39;ll cover more concrete exampels in the <a href="../../../topics/yesod-web-framework-book/authentication-and-authorization/authentication-and-authorization.html#file154-authentication-and-authorizationauthentication-and-authorization">auth chapter</a>.</p>

  <p class="hascomments" id="file63-some-simple-settings/x-3">Not everything in the Yesod typeclass is complicated. Some methods are really very simple
   functions. Let&#39;s just go through the list:</p>
  <dl id="file63-some-simple-settings/x-4">
   
    <dt id="file63-some-simple-settings/x-6">encryptKey</dt>
    <dd id="file63-some-simple-settings/x-7">Yesod uses client-side sessions, which are stored in encrypted, cryptographically-hashed
     cookies. Well, as long as you provide an encryption key. If this function returns Nothing, then
     sessions are disabled. This can be a useful optimization on sites that don&#39;t need session
     facilities, as it avoids an encrypt/decrypt pair on each request.</dd>
   
   
    <dt id="file63-some-simple-settings/x-9">clientSessionDuration</dt>
    <dd id="file63-some-simple-settings/x-10">How long a session should last for. By default, this is two hours.</dd>
   
   
    <dt id="file63-some-simple-settings/x-12">sessionIpAddress</dt>
    <dd id="file63-some-simple-settings/x-13">By default, sessions are tied to an individual IP address. If your users are sitting behind
     a proxy server, this can cause trouble when their IP suddenly changes. This setting lets you
     disable this security feature.</dd>
   
   
    <dt id="file63-some-simple-settings/x-15">cookiePath</dt>
    <dd id="file63-some-simple-settings/x-16">What paths within your current domain to set cookies for. The default is &quot;/&quot;, and will
     almost always be correct. One exception might be when you&#39;re serving from a subpath within a
     domain (like our <a href="../../../topics/yesod-web-framework-book/yesod-typeclass/yesod-typeclass.html#file56-rendering-and-parsing-urlstypeclass/rpu4">wiki example above</a>).</dd>
   
   
    <dt id="file63-some-simple-settings/x-19">maximumContentLength</dt>
    <dd id="file63-some-simple-settings/x-20">To prevent Denial of Server (DoS) attacks, Yesod will limit the size of request bodies. Some
     of the time, you&#39;ll want to bump that limit for some routes (e.g., a file upload page). This is
     where you&#39;d do that.</dd>
