   <title>Forms</title>
   <para/>
   <para/>
   <para>I've mentioned the boundary issue already: whenever data enters or leaves an
   application, we need to validate it. Probably the most difficult place this occurs is forms.
   Coding forms is complex; in an ideal world, we'd like a solution that addresses the following
   problems:</para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>Ensure data is valid.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Marshal string data in the form submission to Haskell datatypes.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Generate HTML code for displaying the form.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Generate Javascript to do clientside validation and provide more user-friendly widgets, such
    as date pickers.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Build up more complex forms by combining together simpler forms.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>Automatically assign names to our fields that are guaranteed to be unique.</para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>The <function>yesod-form</function> package provides all these features in a simple, declarative
   API. It builds on top of Yesod's widgets to simplify styling of forms and applying Javascript
   appropriately. And like the rest of Yesod, it uses Haskell's type system to make sure everything
   is working correctly.</para>

   <section>
    <title>Kinds of Forms</title>
    <para/>
    <para>Before jumping into the types themselves, we should begin with an overview of the different
   kinds of forms. There are three categories:</para>
    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Applicative</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>These are the most commonly used (it's what appeared in the synopsis). Applicative
     gives us some nice properties of letting error messages coallesce together and keep a very
     high-level, declarative approach. (For more information on applicative code, see <link href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Applicative_functor">the Haskell wiki</link>.)</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Monadic</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>A more powerful alternative to applicative. While this allows you more flexibility,
     it does so at the cost of being more verbose. Useful if you want to create forms that don't fit
     into the standard two-column look.</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Input</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>Used only for receiving input. Does not generate any HTML for receiving the user input.
     Useful for interacting with existing forms.</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>In addition, there are a number of different variables that come into play for each form and
   field you will want to set up:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>Is the field required or optional?</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>Should it be submitted with GET or POST?</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>Does it have a default value, or not?</para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>An overriding goal is to minimize the number of field definitions and let them work in
   as many contexts as possible. One result of this is that we end up with a few extra words for
   each field. In the synopsis, you may have noticed things like <literal>areq</literal> and that
   extra <literal>Nothing</literal> parameter. We'll cover why all of those exist in the course of
   this chapter, but for now realize that by making these parameters explicit, we are able to reuse
   the individuals fields (like <function>intField</function>)
   in many different ways.</para>
    <para>A quick note on naming conventions. Each form type has a one-letter prefix (A, M and I) which
   is used in a few places, such as saying MForm. We also use req and opt to mean required and
   optional. Combining these, we create a required applicative field with <literal>areq</literal>, or
   an optional input field with <literal>iopt</literal>.</para>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>Types</title>
    <para/>
    <para>The <function>Yesod.Form.Types</function> module declares a few types. Let's start off
   with some simple helpers:</para>
    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Enctype</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>The encoding type, either <literal>UrlEncoded</literal> or <literal>Multipart</literal>.
     This datatype declares an instance of <literal>ToHtml</literal>, so you can use the enctype
     directly in Hamlet.</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Env</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>Maps a parameter name to a list of values.</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>FileEnv</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>Maps a parameter name to the associated uploaded file.</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Ints</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>As mentioned in the introduction, <literal>yesod-form</literal> automatically assigns
     a unique name to each field. <literal>Ints</literal> is used to keep track of the next number to
     assign.</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>FormResult</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>Has one of three possible states: <literal>FormMissing</literal> if no data was
     submitted, <literal>FormFailure</literal> if there was an error parsing the form (e.g., missing a
     required field, invalid content), or <literal>FormSuccess</literal> if everything went
     smoothly.</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>Next we have three datatypes used for defining individual fields.</para>
    <note>
     <para>A field is a single piece of information, such as a number, a string or an email address.
   Fields are combined together to build forms.</para>
    </note>
    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Field</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>Defines two pieces of functionality: how to parse the text input from a user into a
     Haskell value, and how to create the widget to be displayed to the user.
      <literal>yesod-form</literal> defines a number of individual Fields in <function>Yesod.Form.Fields</function>.</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>FieldSettings</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>Basic information on how a field should be displayed, such as the display name, an
     optional tooltip, and possibly hardcoded <literal>id</literal> and <literal>name</literal>
     attributes. (If none are provided, they are automatically generated.)<note>
         <para>
          <literal>FieldSettings</literal> provides an <literal>IsString</literal> instance, so when you
      need to provide a <literal>FieldSettings</literal> value, you can actually type in a literal
      string. That's how we interacted with it in the synopsis.</para>
        </note>
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>FieldView</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>An intermediate format containing a bunch of view information on a field. This is hardly
     ever used directly by the user, we'll see more details later.</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>And finally, we get to the important stuff: the forms themselves. There are three
   types for this: <literal>MForm</literal> is for monadic forms, <literal>AForm</literal> for
   applicative and <literal>IForm</literal> (declared in <function>IForm</function>) for input. <literal>MForm</literal> is actually a
   type synonym for a monad stack that provides the following features:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>A <literal>Reader</literal> monad giving us the parameters (<literal>Env</literal> and
     <literal>FileEnv</literal>), the master site argument and the list of languages the user
    supports. The last two are used for i18n (more on this later).</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>A <literal>Writer</literal> monad keeping track of the <literal>Enctype</literal>. A
    form will always be <literal>UrlEncoded</literal>, unless there is a file input field, which will
    force us to use multipart instead.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>A <literal>State</literal> monad holding an <literal>Ints</literal> to keep track of the
    next unique name to produce.</para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>An <literal>AForm</literal> is pretty similar. However, there are a few major
   differences:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>It produces a list of <literal>FieldViews</literal>. This allows us to keep an
    abstract idea of the form display, and then at the end of the day choose an appropriate function
    for laying it out on the page. In the synopsis, we used <literal>renderDivs</literal>, which
    creates a bunch of div tags. Another option would be <literal>renderTable</literal>.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>It does not provide a <literal>Monad</literal> instance. The goal of
     <literal>Applicative</literal> is to allow the entire form to run, grab as much information on
    each field as possible, and then create the final result. This cannot work in the context of
     <literal>Monad</literal>.</para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>An <literal>IForm</literal> is even simpler: it returns either a list of error messages
   or a result.</para>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>Converting</title>
    <para/>
    <para>"But wait a minute," you say. "You said the synopsis uses applicative forms, but I'm
   sure the type signature said <literal>MForm</literal>. Shouldn't it be Monadic?" That's true, the
   final form we produced was monadic. But what really happened is that we converted an applicative
   form to a monadic one.</para>
    <para>Again, our goal is to reuse code as much as possible, and minimize the number of
   functions in the API. And Monadic forms are more powerful than Applicative, if more clumsy, so
   anything that can be expressed in an Applicative form could also be expressed in a Monadic form.
   There are two core functions that help out with this: <literal>aformToForm</literal> converts any
   applicative form to a monadic one, and <literal>formToAForm</literal> converts certain kinds of
   monadic forms to applicative forms.</para>
    <para>"But wait <emphasis role="bold">another</emphasis> minute," you insist. "I didn't see any
    <literal>aformToForm</literal>!" Also true. The <literal>renderDivs</literal> function takes care of
   that for us.</para>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>Create AForms</title>
    <para/>
    <para>Now that I've (hopefully) convinced you that in our synopsis we were really dealing with
   applicative forms, let's have a look and try to understand how these things get created. Let's
   take a simple example:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">data Car = Car
    { carModel :: Text
    , carYear :: Int
    }
  deriving Show

carAForm :: AForm Synopsis Synopsis Car
carAForm = Car
    &lt;$&gt; areq textField "Model" Nothing
    &lt;*&gt; areq intField "Year" Nothing

carForm :: Html -&gt; MForm Synopsis Synopsis (FormResult Car, Widget)
carForm = renderTable carAForm
</programlisting>
    <para>Here, we've explicitly split up applicative and monadic forms. In <literal>carAForm</literal>, we use the <literal>&lt;$&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;*&gt;</literal> operators. This should not be surprising; these are
            almost always used in applicative-style code. And we have one line for each record in
            our <literal>Car</literal> datatype. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we have a <literal>textField</literal> for the <literal>Text</literal> record, and an
                <literal>intField</literal> for the <literal>Int</literal>
            record.</para>
    <para>Let's look a bit more closely at the <literal>areq</literal> function. Its (simplified)
            type signature is <literal>Field a -&gt; FieldSettings -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; AForm
                a</literal>. So that first argument is going to determine the datatype of this field,
            how to parse it, and how to render it. The next argument,
            <literal>FieldSettings</literal>, tells us the label, tooltip, name and ID of the field.
            In this case, we're using the previously-mentioned <literal>IsString</literal> instance of
                <literal>FieldSettings</literal>.</para>
    <para>And what's up with that <literal>Maybe a</literal>? It provides the optional default
            value. For example, if we want our form to fill in "2007" as the default car year, we
            would use <literal>areq intField "Year" (Just 2007)</literal>. We can even take
            this to the next level, and have a form that takes an optional parameter giving the
            default values.</para>
    <figure xml:id="create-aforms-x9">
     <title>Form with default values</title>
     <programlisting language="haskell">carAForm :: Maybe Car -&gt; AForm Synopsis Synopsis Car

    &lt;$&gt; areq textField "Model" (carModel &lt;$&gt; mcar)
    &lt;*&gt; areq intField "Year" (carYear &lt;$&gt; mcar)
</programlisting>
    </figure>
    <section>
     <title>Optional fields</title>
     <para/>
     <para>Suppose we wanted to have an optional field (like the car color). All we do instead is
            use the <literal>aopt</literal> function.</para>
     <figure xml:id="optional-fields-x2">
      <title>Optional fields</title>
      <programlisting language="haskell">data Car = Car

    &lt;*&gt; areq intField "Year" Nothing
    &lt;*&gt; aopt textField "Color" Nothing
</programlisting>
     </figure>
     <para>And like required fields, the last argument is the optional default value. However,
            this has two layers of Maybe wrapping. This may seem redundant (and it is), but it makes
            it much easier to write code that takes an optional default form parameter, such as in
            the next example.</para>
     <figure xml:id="optional-fields-x6">

   <section>
    <title>Validation</title>
    <para/>
    <para>How would we make our form only accept cars created after 1990? If you remember, we
            said above that the <literal>Field</literal> itself contained the information on what is a
            valid entry. So all we need to do is write a new <literal>Field</literal>, right? Well,
            that would be a bit tedious. Instead, let's just modify an existing one:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">carAForm :: Maybe Car -&gt; AForm Synopsis Synopsis Car
carAForm mcar = Car
    &lt;$&gt; areq textField    "Model" (carModel &lt;$&gt; mcar)
    &lt;*&gt; areq carYearField "Year"  (carYear  &lt;$&gt; mcar)
    &lt;*&gt; aopt textField    "Color" (carColor &lt;$&gt; mcar)
  where
    errorMessage :: Text
    errorMessage = "Your car is too old, get a new one!"

    carYearField = check validateYear intField

    validateYear y
        | y &lt; 1990 = Left errorMessage
        | otherwise = Right y
</programlisting>
    <para>The trick here is the <literal>check</literal> function. It takes a function
                (<literal>validateYear</literal>) that returns either an error message or a modified
            field value. In this example, we haven't modified the value at all. That is usually
            going to be the case. This kind of checking is very common, so we have a shortcut:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">    carYearField = checkBool (&gt;= 1990) errorMessage intField
</programlisting>
    <para>
     <literal>checkBool</literal> takes two parameters: a condition that must be fulfilled,
            and an error message to be displayed if it was not.</para>
    <note>
     <para>You may have noticed the explicit <literal>Text</literal> type signature on
                <literal>errorMessage</literal>. In the presence of
            <literal>OverloadedStrings</literal>, this is necessary. In order to support i18n,
            messages can have many different datatypes, and GHC has no way of determining which
            instance of <literal>IsString</literal> you intended to use.</para>
    </note>
    <para>It's great to make sure the car isn't too old. But what if we want to make sure that
            the year specified is not from the future? In order to look up the current year, we'll
            need to run some <literal>IO</literal>. For such circumstances, we'll need
                <literal>checkM</literal>:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">    carYearField = checkM inPast $ checkBool (&gt;= 1990) errorMessage intField

    inPast y = do
        thisYear &lt;- liftIO getCurrentYear
        return $ if y &lt;= thisYear
            then Right y
            else Left ("You have a time machine!" :: Text)

getCurrentYear :: IO Int
getCurrentYear = do
    now &lt;- getCurrentTime
    let today = utctDay now
    let (year, _, _) = toGregorian today
    return $ fromInteger year
</programlisting>
    <para>
     <literal>inPast</literal> is a function that will return an <literal>Either</literal>
            result. However, it uses a <literal>Handler</literal> monad. We use <literal>liftIO getCurrentYear</literal> to get the current year and then compare it against
            the user-supplied year. Also, notice how we can chain together multiple validators.</para>
    <note>
     <para>Since the <literal>checkM</literal> validator runs in the <literal>Handler</literal>
            monad, it has access to a lot of the stuff you can normally do in Yesod. This is
            especially useful for running database actions, which we'll cover in the Persistent
                chapter.</para>

     <literal>selectFieldList</literal> takes a list of pairs. The first item in the pair is
            the text displayed to the user in the drop-down list, and the second item is the actual
            Haskell value. Of course, the code above looks really repetitive; we can get the same
            result using the Enum and Bounded instance GHC automatically derives for us.</para>

    <title>Running forms</title>
    <para/>
    <para>At some point, we're going to need to take our beautiful forms and produce some results. There
   are a number of different functions available for this, each with its own purpose. I'll go
   through them, starting with the most common.</para>
    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>runFormPost</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>This will run your form against any submitted <literal>POST</literal>
     parameters. If this is not a <literal>POST</literal> submission, it will return a
      <literal>FormMissing</literal>. This automatically inserts a security token as a hidden
     form field to avoid <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">CSRF</ulink> attacks.</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>runFormGet</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>The equivalent of <literal>runFormPost</literal> for GET parameters. In order to
     distinguish a normal <literal>GET</literal> page load from a <literal>GET</literal> submission, it includes an extra <literal>_hasdata</literal> hidden field
     in the form. Also, unlike <code>runFormPost</code>, it does not include CSRF protection.</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>runFormPostNoNonce</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>Same as <literal>runFormPost</literal>, but does not include (or require) the CSRF
     security token.</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>generateFormPost</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>Instead of binding to existing <literal>POST</literal> parameters, acts as if there
     are none. This can be useful when you want to generate a new form after a previous form was
     submitted, such as in a wizard.</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>generateFormGet</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>Same as <literal>generateFormPost</literal>, but for <literal>GET</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>The return type from the first three is <literal>((FormResult a, Widget),
    Enctype)</literal>. The <literal>Widget</literal> will already have any validation errors and
   previously submitted values.</para>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>i18n</title>
    <para/>
    <para>There have been a few references to i18n in this chapter. The topic will get more
   thorough coverage in its
    own chapter, but since it has such a profound effect on <literal>yesod-form</literal>, I
   wanted to give a brief overview. The idea behind i18n in Yesod is to have data types represent
   messages. Each site can have an instance of <literal>RenderMessage</literal> for a given datatype
   which will translate that message based on a list of languages the user accepts. As a result of
   all this, there are a few things you should be aware of:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>There is an automatic instance of <literal>RenderMessage</literal> for
     <literal>Text</literal> in every site, so you can just use plain strings if you don't care about
    i18n support. However, you may need to use explicit type signatures occassionally.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <literal>yesod-form</literal> expresses all of its messages in terms of the
     <literal>FormMessage</literal> datatype. Therefore, to use <literal>yesod-form</literal>, you'll
    need to have an appropriate <literal>RenderMessage</literal> instance. A simple one that uses the
    default English translations would
    be:<programlisting language="haskell">instance RenderMessage MyApp FormMessage where
    renderMessage _ _ = defaultFormMessage</programlisting>This
    is provided automatically by the scaffolded site.</para>
     </listitem>
<!-- Perhaps include this later? <li id="x5">In order to allow multiple different message types to co-exist, we use an existential
    type called <codeph id="x-12">SomeMessage</codeph>. You will occassionally need to wrap your values inside
    of it, though this is not common in normal library use.</li>-->
    </itemizedlist>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>Monadic Forms</title>
    <para/>
    <para>Often times, a simple form layout is adequate, and applicative forms excel at
            this approach. Sometimes, however, you'll want to have a more customized look to your
            form.</para>
    <figure xml:id="monadic-x-4">
     <title>A non-standard form layout</title>
     <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
       <imagedata fileref="../images/monadic-form.png"/>
      </imageobject>
     </mediaobject>
    </figure>
    <para>For these use cases, monadic forms fit the bill. They are a bit more verbose
            than their applicative cousins, but this verbosity allows you to have complete control
            over what the form will look like. In order to generate the form above, we could code
            something like this.</para>

             TemplateHaskell, MultiParamTypeClasses #-}

main :: IO ()
main = warpDebug 3000 MFormExample</programlisting>
    <para>Similar to the applicative <literal>areq</literal>, we use <literal>mreq</literal> for monadic forms. (And yes, there's also
                <literal>mopt</literal> for optional fields.) But there's a big difference:
                <literal>mreq</literal> gives us back a pair of values. Instead of hiding away the
                <function>FieldView</function> value and
            automatically inserting it into a widget, we get the control to insert it as we see
            fit.</para>
    <para>
     <literal>FieldView</literal> has a number of pieces of information. The most
            important is <literal>fvInput</literal>, which is the actual form field. In this example,
            we also use <literal>fvId</literal>, which gives us back the HTML <literal>id</literal>
            attribute of the input tag. In our example, we use that to specify the width of the
            field.</para>
    <para>You might be wondering what the story is with the "this is not used" and
            "neither is this" values. <literal>mreq</literal> takes a <literal>FieldSettings</literal> as its second argument. Since <literal>FieldSettings</literal>
            provides an <literal>IsString</literal> instance, the strings are essentially expanded by
            the compiler
            to:<programlisting language="haskell">fromString "this is not used" == FieldSettings
    { fsLabel = "this is not used"
    , fsTooltip = Nothing
    , fsId = Nothing
    , fsName = Nothing
    , fsClass = []
    }</programlisting>In
            the case of applicative forms, the <literal>fsLabel</literal> and
                <literal>fsTooltip</literal> values are used when constructing your HTML. In the case
            of monadic forms, Yesod does not generate any of the "wrapper" HTML for you, and
            therefore these values are ignored. However, we still keep the
                <literal>FieldSettings</literal> parameter to allow you to override the
                <literal>id</literal> and <literal>name</literal> attributes of your fields if
            desired.</para>
    <para>The other interesting bit is the <literal>extra</literal> value.
                <literal>GET</literal> forms include an extra field to indicate that they
            have been submitted, and <literal>POST</literal> forms include a security tokens
            to prevent CSRF attacks. If you don't include this extra hidden field in your form,
            Yesod will not accept it.</para>
    <para>Other than that, things are pretty straight-forward. We create our
                <literal>personRes</literal> value by combining together the <literal>nameRes</literal>
            and <literal>ageRes</literal> values, and then return a tuple of the person and the
            widget. And in the <literal>getRootR</literal> function, everything looks just like an
            applicative form. In fact, you could swap out our monadic form with an applicative one
            and the code would still work.</para>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>Input forms</title>
    <para/>
    <para>Applicative and monadic forms handle both the generation of your HTML code and the parsing of
   user input. Sometimes, you only want to do the latter, such as when there's an already-existing
   form in HTML somewhere, or if you want to generate a form dynamically using Javascript. In such a
   case, you'll want input forms.</para>
    <para>These work mostly the same as applicative and monadic forms, with some differences:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>You use <literal>runInputPost</literal> and <literal>runInputGet</literal>.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>You use <literal>ireq</literal> and <literal>iopt</literal>. These functions now only
    take two arguments: the field type and the name (i.e., HTML <literal>name</literal> attribute) of
    the field in question.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>After running a form, it returns the value. It doesn't return a widget or an
                encoding type.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>If there are any validation errors, the page returns an "invalid arguments" error page.</para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>You can use input forms to recreate the previous example. Note, however, that the
   input version is less user friendly. If you make a mistake in an applicative or monadic form, you
   will be brought back to the same page, with your previously entered values in the form, and an
   error message explaning what you need to correct. With input forms, the user simply gets an error
   message.</para>

    <title>Custom fields</title>
    <para/>
    <para>The fields that come built-in with Yesod will likely cover the vast majority of your
   form needs. But occassionally, you'll need something more specialized. Fortunately, you can
   create new forms in Yesod yourself. The <literal>Field</literal> datatype has two records:
    <literal>fieldParse</literal> takes a list of values submitted by the user and returns one of
   three results:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>An error message saying validation failed.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>The parsed value.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>Nothing, indicating that no data was supplied.</para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>That last case might sound surprising: shouldn't Yesod automatically know that no information
   is supplied when the input list is empty? Well, no actually. Checkboxes, for instance, indicate
   an unchecked state by sending in an empty list.</para>
    <para>Also, what's up with the list? Shouldn't it be a <literal>Maybe</literal>? Well, that's
   also not the case. With grouped checkboxes and multi-select lists, you'll have multiple widgets
   with the same name. We also use this trick in our example below.</para>
    <para>The second record is <literal>fieldView</literal>, and it renders a widget to display to
   the user. This function has four arguments: the <literal>id</literal> attribute, the
    <literal>name</literal> attribute, the result and a <literal>Bool</literal> indicating if the field
   is required.</para>
    <para>What did I mean by result? It's actually an <literal>Either</literal>, giving either
   the unparsed input (when parsing failed) or the successfully parsed value.
    <literal>intField</literal> is a great example of how this works. If you type in <userinput>42</userinput>, the value of result will be <literal>Right 42</literal>. But
   if you type in <userinput>turtle</userinput>, the result will be <literal>Left
    "turtle"</literal>. This lets you put in a value attribute on your input tag that will give the
   user a consistent experience.</para>
    <para>As a small example, we'll create a new field type that is a password confirm field.
            This field has two text inputs- both with the same name attribute- and returns an error
            message if the values don't match. Note that, unlike most fields, it does <emphasis>not</emphasis> provide a value attribute on the input tags, as you don't want to send back
            a user-entered password in your HTML <emphasis role="bold">ever</emphasis>.</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">passwordConfirmField :: Field sub master Text
passwordConfirmField = Field
    { fieldParse = \rawVals -&gt;
        case rawVals of

    <title>Summary</title>
    <para/>
    <para>Forms in Yesod are broken up into three groups. Applicative is the most common, as it provides
   a nice user interface with an easy-to-use API. Monadic forms give you more power, but are harder
   to use. Input forms are intended when you just want to read data from the user, not generate the
   input widgets.</para>
    <para>There are a number of different <literal>Field</literal>s provided by Yesod out-of-the-box. In
   order to use these in your forms, you need to indicate the kind of form and whether the field is
   required or optional. The result is six helper functions: <literal>areq</literal>,
    <literal>aopt</literal>, <literal>mreq</literal>, <literal>mopt</literal>, <literal>ireq</literal>, and
    <literal>iopt</literal>.</para>
    <para>Forms have significant power available. They can automatically insert Javascript to help you
   leverage nicer UI controls, such as a jQuery UI date picker. Forms are also fully i18n-ready, so
   you can support a global community of users. And when you have more specific needs, you can slap
   on some validation functions to an existing field, or write a new one from scratch.</para>
