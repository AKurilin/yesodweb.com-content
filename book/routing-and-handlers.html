For contrast, let&#39;s describe two other routing approaches used in other web development environments:</p><ul id="file80-routing-and-handlers/x1"><li id="file80-routing-and-handlers/x2">Dispatch based on file name. This is how PHP and ASP work, for example.</li><li id="file80-routing-and-handlers/x3">Have a centralized routing function that parses routes based on regular expressions. Django and Rails follow this approach.</li></ul><p class="hascomments" id="file80-routing-and-handlers/intro2">Yesod is closer in principle to the latter technique. Even so, there are significant differences. Instead of using regular expressions, Yesod matches on pieces of a route. Instead of having a one-way route-to-handler mapping, Yesod has an intermediate data type (called the route datatype, or a type-safe URL) and creates two-way conversion functions.</p><p class="hascomments" id="file80-routing-and-handlers/intro3">Coding this more advanced system manually is tedious and error prone. Therefore, Yesod relies heavily on Template Haskell and Quasi-Quotation to automatically generate this code for you. This chapter will explain the syntax of the routing declarations, give you a glimpse of what code is generated for you, and explain the interaction between routing and handler functions.</p><section class="subtopic" id="file70-route-syntax"><h1>Route Syntax</h1>
        <p class="hascomments" id="file70-route-syntax/x-3">Instead of trying to shoe-horn route declarations into an existing syntax, Yesod&#39;s
            approach is to use a simplified syntax designed just for routes. This has the advantage
            of making the code not only easy to write, but simple enough for even with no Yesod
            experience to read and know the sitemap of your application.</p>
        <p class="hascomments" id="file70-route-syntax/x-4">A simple example of this syntax would be:</p>
        <pre class="codeblock" id="file70-route-syntax/x-5">/             RootR     GET
/blog         BlogR     GET POST
/blog/#BlogId BlogPostR GET POST

/static       StaticR   Static getStatic</pre>
        <p class="hascomments" id="file70-route-syntax/x-6">The next few sections will explain the full details of what goes on in the route
            declaration.</p>
    <section class="subtopic" id="file67-pieces"><h1>Pieces</h1><p class="hascomments" id="file67-pieces/pieces1">One of the first thing Yesod does when it gets a request is split up the requested
                                                path into pieces. The pieces are simply tokenized at
                                                all forward slashes. So:</p><pre class="codeblock" id="file67-pieces/x2">toPieces &quot;/&quot; = []
toPieces &quot;/foo/bar/baz/&quot; = [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;, &quot;&quot;]</pre><p class="hascomments" id="file67-pieces/pieces2">You may notice that there are some funny things going on with
                trailing slashes, or double slashes (&quot;/foo//bar//&quot;), or a few
                other things. Yesod believes in having <dfn id="file67-pieces/x3">canonical
                    URLs</dfn>; if someone requests a URL with a trailing
                slash, or with a double slash, they automatically get a
                redirect to the canonical version. This follows the RESTful
                principle of one URL for one resource, and can help with your
                search rankings.</p><p class="hascomments" id="file67-pieces/pieces3">What this means for you is that you needn&#39;t concern yourself
                with the exact structure of your URLs: you can safely think
                about pieces of a path, and Yesod automatically handles
                intercalating the slashes and escaping problematic
                characters.</p><p class="hascomments" id="file67-pieces/pieces4">If, by the way, you want more fine-tuned control of how paths
                are split into pieces and joined together again, you&#39;ll want to
                look at the cleanPath and joinPath methods in the <a href="../../../topics/yesod-web-framework-book/yesod-typeclass/yesod-typeclass.html">Yesod
                    typeclass</a> chapter.</p><section class="subtopic" id="file66-types-of-pieces"><h1>Types of Pieces</h1><p class="hascomments" id="file66-types-of-pieces/pieces5">When you are declaring your routes, you have three types of pieces at your disposal:</p><dl id="file66-types-of-pieces/x1"><dt id="file66-types-of-pieces/x3">Static</dt><dd id="file66-types-of-pieces/x4">This is a plain string that must be matched against precisely in the URL.</dd><dt id="file66-types-of-pieces/x6">Dynamic single</dt><dd id="file66-types-of-pieces/x7">This is a single piece (ie, between two forward slashes), but can be a user-submitted value. This is the primary method of receiving extra user input on a page request. These pieces begin with a hash (#) and are followed by a data type.

It is specified by an asterisk (*) followed by a datatype, which must be an instance of <code id="file66-types-of-pieces/x12">MultiPiece</code>. Multi pieces are not as common as the other two, though they are very important for implementing features like static trees representing file structure or wikis with arbitrary hierarchies.</dd></dl><p class="hascomments" id="file66-types-of-pieces/pieces6">Let us take a look at some standard kinds of resource patterns you may want to write. Starting simply, the root of an application will just be <code id="file66-types-of-pieces/x13">/</code>.

                Therefore, it has to start with a capital letter. By
                convention, these resource names all end with a capital R.
                There is nothing forcing you to do this, it is just

                arguments to the datatype. This gives us a 1-to-1

                 resource name, such as <code id="file69-handler-specification/x6">/page/faq FaqR</code>. In this
                 case, the handler function must be named
                 <code id="file69-handler-specification/x7">handleFaqR</code>.</p><p class="hascomments" id="file69-handler-specification/rn9">A separate handler for each request method will be the same,
                 plus a list of request methods. The request methods must be

                     PersonR GET POST DELETE</code>. In this case, you would
                 need to define the three handler functions
                 <code id="file69-handler-specification/x9">getPersonR</code>, <code id="file69-handler-specification/x10">postPersonR</code> and

                     later</a>, but using them is not too difficult. The
                 most commonly used subsite is the static subsite, which serves
                 static files for your application. In order to serve static
                 files from <code id="file69-handler-specification/x13">/static</code>, you would need a resource

There is a more general version,
                called a GHandler, which allows you to specify the subsite and master site. Each
                application has the following type alias
                defined:<pre class="codeblock" id="file78-the-ghandler-monad/x-3">type Handler = GHandler MyApp MyApp</pre>And on top of all
                this, there is in fact a larger generalization from GHandler- a GGHandler- which
                allows you to replace the inner monad. While a GHandler wraps around an Iteratee,
                which allows it to read the request body, a GGHandler can wrap around any monad,
                including directly around IO. This generalization is necessary for dealing with
                catching exceptions. We will discuss this in more depth later. The relationship
                between GHandler and GGHandler
                is:<pre class="codeblock" id="file78-the-ghandler-monad/x-4">type GHandler sub master = GGHandler sub master (Iteratee ByteString IO)</pre></p></aside><p class="hascomments" id="file78-the-ghandler-monad/ghandler2">The remainder of this chapter will give a brief introduction to some of the most

Some of these are:</p><dl id="file74-application-information/x1"><dt id="file74-application-information/x3">getYesod</dt><dd id="file74-application-information/x4">Returns your applicaton foundation value. If you store configuration values in your foundation, you will probably end up using this function a lot.</dd><dt id="file74-application-information/x6">getYesodSub</dt><dd id="file74-application-information/x7">Get the subsite foundation value. Unless you are working in a subsite, this will return the same value as <code id="file74-application-information/x8">getYesod</code>.</dd><dt id="file74-application-information/x10">getUrlRender</dt><dd id="file74-application-information/x11">Returns the <dfn id="file74-application-information/x12">URL rendering function</dfn>, which converts a type-safe URL into a <code id="file74-application-information/x13">String</code>. Most of the time- like with Hamlet- Yesod calls this function for you, but you may occassionally need to call it directly.</dd><dt id="file74-application-information/x15">getUrlRenderParams</dt><dd id="file74-application-information/x16">A variant of <code id="file74-application-information/x17">getUrlRender</code> that converts both a type-safe URL and a list of query-string parameters.

            requested path, the query string parameters and POSTed form data. The first of those is
            dealt with in the routing, as described above. The other two are best dealt with using
            the <a href="../../../topics/yesod-web-framework-book/forms-09/forms.html#file94-formsforms">forms module</a>.</p><p class="hascomments" id="file75-request-information/ghandler5">That said, you will sometimes need to get the data in a more raw format. For this purpose, Yesod exposes the <code id="file75-request-information/x2">Request</code> datatype along with the <code id="file75-request-information/x3">getRequest</code> function to retrieve it. This gives you access to the full list of GET parameters, cookies, and preferred languages. There are some convenient functions to make these lookups easier, such as <code id="file75-request-information/x4">lookupGetParam</code>, <code id="file75-request-information/x5">lookupCookie</code> and <code id="file75-request-information/x6">languages</code>.
